<p class="noi title">LEFTY O’ THE BUSH</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br>
<small>OUT IN THE BUSH</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">After running his eye over the Kingsbridge
batting order, Mike Riley, manager
of the Bancroft “Bullies,” rolled the
black cigar well into the corner of his mouth,
lifted himself ponderously to his feet, and walked
across toward the bench of the home team.</p>

<p>Kingsbridge had taken the field for practice,
the visitors having warmed up already. The
Northern League, a genuine “bush” organization,
had opened two days earlier in Bancroft and
Fryeburg, but this was to be the first game of the
season in Kingsbridge, a hustling, crude, though
ambitious pulp-mill town.</p>

<p>As it was Saturday afternoon, when the mills
closed down at three o’clock, there was certain
to be a big crowd in attendance, double assurance
of which could be seen in the rapidly filling grand
stand and bleachers, and the steady stream of humanity
pouring in through the gates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>As Riley approached, a lean, sallow man, with
a hawk-beak nose, rose from the home bench and
nodded, holding out a bony hand, which, cold as
a dead fish, was almost smothered in the pudgy
paw put forth to meet it.</p>

<p>“Hello, Hutch!” gurgled the manager of the
Bullies, with a show of cordiality, although he
quickly dropped the chilling hand. “How’s
tricks? See you took a fall outer Fryeburg yistidday.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we got away with it,” answered the local
manager, in a monotonous, dead-level voice, lacking
wholly in enthusiasm. “But the ‘Brownies’
are a cinch; nothing but a bunch of raw kids.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh!” grunted Riley, twisting his thumb
into the huge watch chain which spanned the
breadth of his bulging waistcoat; “that’s right.
Still, you didn’t have much leeway to spare, did
ye?”</p>

<p>“Put it over by one measly run, that’s all.
Deever’s arm went on the blink in the seventh,
and the greenhorns came near hammering out a
win. Locke managed to hold ’em.”</p>

<p>“Who is this Locke? I see he’s down to wing
’em for you to-day. Where’d you find him,
huh?”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me who he is. I never heard of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
him before. He’s some green dub of a port-side
flinger old man Cope picked up. You know Cope
used to play the game back in the days of the Deluge,
and he thinks he knows all about it. As he’s
chairman of the Kingsbridge Baseball Association,
and one of the heaviest backers of the team,
folks round here let him meddle enough to keep
him appeased. All the same, long as they’ve
hired me to manage, I’m going to manage, after
I’ve shown ’em how much Cope don’t know about
it.”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk, Hutch,” chuckled the Bancroft
manager. “You’ve got some team, and you
oughter be able to make it interestin’ for the rest
of us, if the rubes let you have your swing. It
was that old fox, Cope, who got Deever away from
me arter I had Pat as good as signed, which makes
me feel a bit raw, natural. Outside of Deever,
and Locke, and a few others, I s’pose the team’s
practically your make-up?”</p>

<p>“Then you’ve got another guess coming,” returned
Bob Hutchinson. “Skillings, Lace, Crandall,
and Hickey make the whole of my picking;
Cope practically got together the rest of the bunch.
But wait; some of ’em won’t hold their jobs long,
between you and me, Mike.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we hadn’t better chin any longer, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
I see we’re being watched, and the people of this
town are so hot against Bancroft, and you in particular,
that they might get suspicious, and think
there was something crooked doing if we talked
too long.”</p>

<p>“Guess that’s right,” admitted Riley. “They
ain’t got no love for me in Kingsbridge, ’count of
our rubbing it inter them last year. Makes me
laugh, the way they squealed. They were so sore
they swore they’d have a team to beat us this
year at any cost. That’s how you got your job;
they decided to have a reg’ler manager, who
could give all his time and attention to handlin’
the team. Sorry for you, Hutch, but if they beat
Bancroft under the wire with the bunch they’ve
scraped together, I’ll quit the game for good. So
long.”</p>

<p>Having learned that Hutchinson was not wholly
responsible for the make-up of the Kingsbridge
nine, Riley did not hesitate to express himself in
this manner, thus betraying the disdain in which
he really held his opponents of the day.</p>

<p>Only once since the organization of the so-called
Northern League, which really had very little organization
whatever, being run, like many small,
back-country “leagues,” in a loose, hit-or-miss
fashion—only once had Bancroft failed to win<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
the championship; and that year Riley, a minor
leaguer before age and avoirdupois had deposited
him in the can, had not handled the club.</p>

<p>Bancroft was a city, and it cut her fans deeply
to be downed on the diamond by a smaller place,
besides severely wounding in their pockets some
of the sports who had wagered real money.
Hence the former successful manager was called
back to the job, at which he was always prepared
to make good through any means available.</p>

<p>Kingsbridge had entered the league the previous
season, filling the place of a town that, loaded
with baseball debts, and discouraged by poor success,
had dropped out. Owing its existence to
Cyrus King, lumberman and pulp manufacturer,
Kingsbridge was barely four years old, yet its
inhabitants already numbered nearly five thousand.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it was confidently looking forward
to the time, believed to be not far distant,
when it should outstrip the already envious city
of Bancroft, and become the “metropolis” of that
particular region.</p>

<p>While pretending to scoff at the “mushroom
village,” Bancroft was secretly disturbed and
worried, fearing the day when Kingsbridge,
through the enterprise of its citizens, the interest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
and power of its founder, and the coming of a second
railroad, which was seeking a charter, would
really forge to the front, and leave the “big town
down the river” in the lurch. Therefore, quite
naturally, the rivalry between the two places was
intense in other things besides baseball.</p>

<p>There is nothing like the game, however, to
bring to the surface the jealousies and rivalries
existing between towns having contending teams;
something about the game is certain to tear open
old sores and stir up ancient animosities apparently
long forgotten.</p>

<p>Especially is this true in minor leagues and
“out in the bush,” where not infrequently it appears
to the chance stranger that whole towns—men,
women, and children—have gone baseball
crazy.</p>

<p>It is in such places that one may see the game,
as a game, at its best—and its worst. Here victory
or defeat assumes a tragic importance that
must seem laughable to the ordinary city fan; the
former being frequently the cause of rejoicing and
celebrating, sometimes with fireworks and brass
bands, while the latter will cast over the community
a cloud of gloom which could be equaled
only by an appalling catastrophe.</p>

<p>This intensity of feeling and emotion may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
scarcely be understood by a person who has never
followed with individual interest the fortunes of
a backwoods team, tasting the sweet intoxication
of triumph, hard earned and contested to the last
ditch, or the heartbreaking bitterness of defeat
and shattered hopes.</p>

<small>UNDER COVER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Kingsbridge, with its pulp-mill and
saw-mill laborers, was precisely the sort
of a place to back a team to the limit, and
to demand a winning club, regardless of expense.</p>

<p>On Saturdays, because of the early shutting
down of the mills, nearly all the laborers could
get out to witness the contests, and few there were
who failed to attend, unless sickness or imperative
necessity kept them away. In fact, on the
last day of the week, the attendance in that town
was as large as the average turnout in Bancroft.</p>

<p>The mill town’s initial experience had been
most unsatisfactory and discouraging. Starting
out with a nine made up of youngsters, among
whom were college men and high-school boys, it
had made a promising beginning, actually standing
at the head of the league for almost three
weeks, and then fighting Bancroft for first place
for an equal length of time.</p>

<p>But the youngsters did not seem to have staying
qualities, and this, combined with poor management<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
and the “fair-or-foul” methods of the
Bullies, had eventually sent Kingsbridge down the
ladder to finish the season at the very foot of the
list.</p>

<p>This failure, however, simply aroused the town
to grim determination, bringing about the organization
of a baseball association which included
many of the leading citizens, Henry Cope, who
kept the largest general store in town, being
chosen chairman. The association pledged itself
to put a winning team on to the field, and Cope,
having considerable knowledge of baseball and
players, set to work in midwinter preparing for
the coming campaign. He was given a comparatively
free hand by his associates, although, in
order that Bancroft might not hear and get wise,
the purpose of his movements was kept secret
until it was almost time for the league to open.</p>

<p>Then it became known that Bob Hutchinson, a
manager who had handled teams in one of the well
known minor leagues, had been secured to take
charge of the “Kinks.” It was also made public
that a team of fast and experienced players
throughout had been signed, and the names of
several of these players were printed in the sporting
column of the Bancroft <cite>News</cite>.</p>

<p>Hope flamed high in Kingsbridge. The topic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
of the street corners was baseball. It was freely
proclaimed that the town was prepared to take a
heavy fall out of Bancroft, and would begin by
downing the “hated enemy” in the very first clash,
which was scheduled to occur in the down-river
city.</p>

<p>Of course a few pessimistic killjoys, of whom
every community must have its quota, scoffed at
the efforts and expectations of the enthusiasts, declaring
it was not possible for a place no larger
than Kingsbridge, no matter how earnestly it
might try, to defeat a city with Bancroft’s record
and resources. These croakers were not popular,
yet their gloomy prophecies awakened misgivings
in many a heart.</p>

<p>In Bancroft the midwinter silence of Kingsbridge
had aroused some alarm lest the mill
town, troubled with cold feet, should fail to come
to the scratch when the season opened, which
would make it necessary to lure some other place
into the fold, or run the league three-cornered,
something most unpleasant and undesirable.</p>

<p>Even when Kingsbridge sent a representative
to attend the usual annual meeting of the league
association, the quiet declination of that representative
to give out any particulars concerning
the personnel of the up-river team had left a feeling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
of uneasiness, despite his repeated assurance
that there would be such a team.</p>

<p>Later, on the appearance of the newspaper report
that Kingsbridge had engaged Bob Hutchinson
as manager, and the publication of an incomplete
roster of the mill-town players, Bancroft’s
relief and satisfaction had been tempered
by alarm of a different nature. For it now became
apparent that the city’s ambitious rival had
all along been quietly at work preparing to spring
a surprise in the form of an unusually strong nine
that would make the other clubs go some, right
from the call of “play.”</p>

<p>Mike Riley had not sought to allay this final
feeling of apprehension; on the contrary, for
purely personal reasons, he fostered it. For
would it not encourage the backers of his team,
believing as they did in his sound baseball sense,
to give him even greater liberty in management?
And when he should again win the championship,
as he secretly and egotistically felt certain
of doing, the luster of the accomplishment must
seem far more dazzling than usual.</p>

<p>After Bancroft’s opening-day success, when
she had rubbed it into the Kinks to the tune of 8
to 4, Riley became completely satisfied that the
Kingsbridge nine was a false alarm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>Aware of Hutchinson’s particular weaknesses,
he had never really feared the man; but let this
much be said to Riley’s credit: whenever possible,
he preferred to capture victory by the skill and
fighting ability of his team, rather than through
secret deals and shady, underhanded methods.
And he always developed a team of aggressive,
browbeating fighters; hence the far-from-pleasing
appellation of “Bullies.”</p>

<p>In her second game, Kingsbridge’s victory over
Fryeburg had come as a surprise to Manager
Riley, whose judgment had led him to believe that
the Brownies would also open the season with a
triumph on their own field. Hence his desire to
question Hutchinson about it.</p>

<p>Tom Locke, the new pitcher who had relieved
Pat Deever when the Fryeburgers took Deever’s
measure in the seventh, was an unknown to Riley,
and, the chap being slated to go against Bancroft
this day, Mike had sought information concerning
him.</p>

<p>Hutchinson, however, could tell him nothing
save that the young man had been signed by Henry
Cope; but, holding Cope’s baseball judgment
openly in contempt, this seemed sufficiently relieving,
and, complacently chewing his black cigar,
he confidently returned to the Bancroft bench.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br>
<small>THE MAN TO PITCH</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">To the left of the bench, which was set well
back against the railing in front of the
third-base bleachers, on which a carload
of Bancroft fans were bunched, Jock Hoover, the
star slabman of the team, was warming up with
Bingo Bangs, the catcher.</p>

<p>Hoover, speedy, pugnacious, with an arm of
iron, the face of a Caliban, and the truculence of
an Attila, was well calculated to inspire respect
and fear when on the mound; and his mid-season
acquirement by Bancroft the year before had
doubtless fixed that team in first position, and
marked the assured downfall of Kingsbridge,
against whom he was most frequently worked.</p>

<p>In Bancroft, Hoover was admired and toadied;
in Kingsbridge he was most cordially hated.
More than once his intimidating methods on the
latter field had come perilously close to producing
a riot, which, had it ever started among the mill
men, must have been a nasty affair.</p>

<p>Never in the most threatening moments of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
rough crowd’s clamoring, however, had Hoover
turned a hair. Always through it all he had
sneered and grinned contemptuously, apparently
inviting assault, and showing disappointment when
the better element among the crowd, who cared
for the sport as a sport, and knew the harm to
the game that a pitched battle must bring, succeeded
in holding the hot-headed and reckless ones
in check.</p>

<p>Biting off the end of his cigar, Riley stood
watching Hoover meditatively. Out on the field
the locals were getting in the last snappy bit of
preliminary practice, and the game would begin
in a few minutes. The manager’s eyes had left
Hoover and sought “Butch” Prawley, one of the
other two pitchers, when a hand touched his arm,
and some one spoke to him. Rolling his head toward
his shoulder, he saw “Fancy” Dyke standing
on the other side of the rail.</p>

<p>Francis Dyke, a young sporting man of Bancroft,
was one of the backers of the team. To him
a baseball game on which he had not placed a
wager worth while was necessarily slow and uninteresting,
even though well fought and contested
to the finish. Son of a horseman who had won
and lost big sums on the turf, Fancy, apparently
inheriting the gaming instinct, had turned to baseball<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
with the decline of racing. His nickname
came through his taste for flashy clothes.</p>

<p>“Don’t you do it,” said Dyke, vapory bits of
bluish cigarette smoke curling from his thin lips
as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Do what?” grunted Riley in surprise.</p>

<p>“Run in Prawley. You were thinking of letting
Hoover squat on the bench.”</p>

<p>“How’d you know that?” asked the manager,
still more surprised.</p>

<p>“Saw it on your face.”</p>

<p>“If my mug gives me away in that fashion, I’ll
trade it for another,” growled Mike, in displeasure.
“But why not pitch Prawley? He can
swaller that bunch, one after another, without
greasin’. This is our first game here, and Jock
ain’t so pop’ler in this town.”</p>

<p>“What do you care about that? It’s our first
game here, and we want it, to hold first place. If
they should happen to trim us to-day, they’d have
us tied.”</p>

<p>With the mutilated and lifeless cigar gripped
in his coarse teeth, Riley pulled down the corners
of his big mouth disdainfully. “Trim us—with
that bunch of scrubs and has-beens! Why, they
couldn’t do it if I went in and pitched myself.”</p>

<p>“Take it from me, ’tain’t wise to be so cocksure.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
I’ve been watching their new pitcher warm
up. He’s a southpaw.”</p>

<p>“And a green one from the scrub pastures somewhere.
The boys will send him to the stable in
about three innin’s.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. But I walked over in range while
he was limbering his flinger, and he’s got a few
good benders, not to mention some speed. You
don’t want to forget that we’ve got five left-hand
batters, and a southpaw that can really pitch
may bother ’em some. I reckon that’s just why
they’ve raked in this feller Locke.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you b’lieve it. Just spoke to Hutch
about him, and Hutch don’t know no more’n you
or me. Old Cope signed Locke and the most of
the team, and he’d never figger on a lefty worryin’
us because we’ve got so many left-hand hitters.”</p>

<p>“That,” persisted Dyke, “don’t alter the conditions
any. This Locke stopped Fryeburg
after they blanketed Deever, and Kingsbridge
wants this game to-day—<em>bad</em>. I’ve heard some of
the Bridgers talkin’, and they’re plenty confident,
thinking they’ve got a wiz in this southpaw kid.</p>

<p>“To-morrow’s Sunday, and Hoover can rest,”
he added. “He’s hard as nails, and you won’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
hurt him, even if you have to use him again Monday.
Always play the game safe when you can—that’s
my motto. I’ll take chances, all right, if
I have to, but I’ve never yet let my conscience fret
me into ducking a bet on a sure thing. Hoover is
the Kinks’ hoodoo, and it ought to be pretty safe
with him handing ’em.”</p>

<p>“Safe,” gurgled Riley, highly amused. “I
should guess yes. They think they’ve got some
players, but, with Hutchinson furnishin’ only four
out of the ’leven men they have, as he told me, and
Cope diggin’ up the rest, most of ’em holdovers
from last year, it’s a joke.</p>

<p>“Why, I let old Cope have Pat Deever, though
he thinks he got Deever away from me. Just as
I was about to close with Pat, I got it straight that
he’d put his wing on the blink for fair, and, by
pretendin’ I was hot after Deever all the time,
I helped him make a fancy deal with Cope.</p>

<p>“Pat was batted out by the Brownies after
fooling ’em along to the seventh with a slow ball
that made him sweat drops of blood ev’ry time he
boosted it over the pan; but he’s foxy, and he’ll
manage to hang on by bluffing ’em that his arm’ll
come round soon, see if he don’t,” added Riley.
“The only pitcher they’ve got is Skillings, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
even he’s frappéd his wing, pitchin’ the drop all
the time, which he has to, as he’s a mark when he
lets up on it.”</p>

<p>“You’re manager,” said Fancy, “and I’m not
trying to show you; but I hope you’ll play safe
by sending Hoover out to start with. If it proves
so easy, you can pull him out when you see the
game is clinched.”</p>

<p>“All right. Jock’s name is on the battin’
order, and I’ll let him start her off.”</p>

<small>THE PARSON’S DAUGHTER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Dyke expressed satisfaction, and the
hazelnut sparkler in his blazing red tie
reflected varicolored gleams from its
many facets, as his cupped hands held a burning
match to light a fresh cigarette.</p>

<p>As he flung aside the match, and chanced to
glance past the far end of the bleachers, his black
eyes glinted on beholding a girl in a light dress,
shading herself with a pale-blue parasol, and
seated in a carriage that had just drawn up in
line with others out there. A span of spirited
and extremely restless bays were attached to the
carriage. At the girl’s side, wearing a light suit,
straw hat, and tan driving gloves, sat a square-shouldered
young man.</p>

<p>“Hel-lo!” breathed Fancy. “There’s old man
King’s cub, with the parson’s daughter. I don’t
blame him, for she certainly is some peach. She
must be getting independent; last year I offered to
get her a season ticket, but she said her hidebound
old man wouldn’t let her come to the games, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
he considered sinful and poisonous to the morals
of the community.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted Riley, eyeing the girl in the
carriage. “She’s a year older now, and mebbe
she’s given the old pulpit pounder notice that she
proposes henceforth to do about as she pleases.
I’ve heard she’s ruther high-strung and lively.”</p>

<p>“Well, she’s taking a chance with Bent King,
’cording to his college record. He cut it out so
hot that he was fired the second year, and then his
old man, feeling somewhat peeved, set him to
work in the big mill here. Now the brat’s foreman
of the mill, though I reckon it was his father
that put him there over better men, and not his
ability.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re jealous,” chuckled the manager.
“She turned you down when you tried to git gay,
that’s what’s the matter. You oughter considered,
Fancy, that your record was agin’ ye, and
that you was known by reputation in Kingsbridge,
just as well as in Bancroft. I’ve noticed the right
sorter gals don’t travel in your society extensively.”</p>

<p>Dyke’s thin cheek took on a faint flush, and he
gnawed with his sharp white teeth one corner of
his close-cropped, small black mustache.</p>

<p>“I reckon she’d be as safe with me as with Bent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
King,” he retorted. “Of course, I know what
her old man would think of me; but in these days
girls don’t tell their folks about every man they’re
friendly with.”</p>

<p>“There’s old Cope speakin’ to her now,” said
Riley. “Looket him take the cover off that
skatin’ rink of his. There’s real swagger gallantry
for ye, Flash.”</p>

<p>A stout, red-faced, jolly-looking man in a somewhat
soiled snuff-colored suit had paused beside
the carriage to lift his hat and speak to the girl,
who greeted him with a charming smile and a
show of fetching dimples.</p>

<p>“Howdy-do, Janet,” said the man on the
ground. “I’m s’prised to see you here, though
I b’lieve you did tell me you was crazy over baseball.
Your father’s so set agin’ it that I didn’t
s’pose he’d let you come. Howdy-do, Benton.
Fine day for the opening.”</p>

<p>“Oh, father is as bad as ever,” laughed the
girl; “but I told Bent how much I wanted to
come, and he drove round and used his persuasion
with daddy, who finally consented, after getting a
promise that I would sit in the carriage and not
step out of it. It was jolly nice of Benton, for I
am crazy over the game, and I’d go to see one
every day if I could.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>She was fresh and girlish and unaffected, yet,
somehow, she did not give one the impression of
crudity and silliness so often shown by a vivacious,
blue-eyed blonde. Although very pretty,
she was not doll-like, and one who studied her
mobile, changeful face would soon discover there,
as well as in her voice and manner, unmistakable
signs of good breeding and character. Her eyes
were unusual; one could not look into their depths
without feeling irresistibly attracted toward her.</p>

<p>The young man at her side, a well-set-up chap
a trifle above medium height, was the only son of
Cyrus King. He was not more than twenty-four,
and had a somewhat cynical, haughty face, with a
pair of flashing dark eyes and petulant mouth.
Nevertheless, when he laughed, which he did quite
frequently, he was attractive, almost handsome.</p>

<p>“Yes, Cope,” he nodded, as the older man
brought forth a handkerchief and mopped his
perspiring bald head; “it certainly is a good day
for the opening, and there’s a cracking crowd out
to see it. They’re beginning to overflow the
seats. Suppose we have any show at all to win?”</p>

<p>“Hey?” cried the chairman of the baseball association.
“Any show to win? You bet we
have! We’re <em>goin’</em> to win. We’ve got to have
this first game at home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>“But we’re up against Bancroft, and I see Jock
Hoover has just finished warming up to pitch
for them.”</p>

<p>“That’ll jest make it all the more interestin’.
We’ve got a pitcher, too, I want you to know. I
signed him myself, and he’ll make ’em set up and
take notice. You jest watch Tom Locke when he
goes inter the box.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard something about him. Who is he?
And where did you get him?”</p>

<p>Running the handkerchief round the sweatband
inside his soiled straw hat, Henry Cope winked
shrewdly, and covered his shining dome.</p>

<p>“Why, didn’t I tell ye his name is Tom Locke?
Never mind where I picked him up. He’s got the
goods, and he’ll deliver ’em. If he don’t jest
naturally make them Bullies break their backs
poundin’ empty air to-day, I’ll be the most
s’prised man in the county.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope he <em>is</em> good!” exclaimed the girl.
“Everybody in town was disappointed over the
way Bancroft beat us last year. They all said
we needed one corking good pitcher to put up
against Bancroft’s best man.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got him,” assured Henry Cope.
“We’ve got the very feller in this here Locke.
You watch and see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>“There goes the umpire,” said King. “They
are going to start the game.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” said Cope hastily. “I think I’ll
git over by our bench, where I can watch Locke
work. That’s him—that tall, slim chap goin’
inter the box now. Jest keep your eye on him.
So long.”</p>

<p>He hurried away as the umpire called “play”
and Bancroft’s first batter rose and trotted out
from the bench.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br>
<small>A BAD BEGINNING</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">A yell rose from the crowd which now almost
completely encircled the field. It
was not a cheer, such as may sometimes
be heard at the beginning of a Big League game;
it was a sudden, sharp, nerve-shocking combination
of bellow and shriek, primitive in its methodless
manner of expressing joyous satisfaction and
elation that the moment had arrived for the contest
to begin. Thus may have a gathering of
primordial mankind, assembled to witness some
sort of sanguinary gladiatorial contest, voiced its
fierce emotion at the sight of trained warriors
charging upon one another in the arena.</p>

<p>This burst of sound died away in a few scattering
whoops and yelps as the umpire, body protector
adjusted, mask held ready, lifted his hand
for silence.</p>

<p>“Game t’-day,” he shouted hoarsely, “Bancrof’
ag’inst Kingsbridge. Bat’ry f’r Kingsbridge,
Locke ’n’ Oulds; bat’ry f’r Bancroft, Hoover ’n’
Bangs. Pla-a-ay ball-ll!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>“Ye-ee-ee!” shrieked the crowd, and then settled
down to enjoy the struggle.</p>

<p>Bill Harney, clever sticker and captain of
the Bancroft team, was ready at the plate.
“Hunchy” Oulds, breastplated and masked, spat
into the pocket of his catching mitt, rubbed the
moisture about on the dented leather with his
fingers, and then squatted behind the pan to signal.
The umpire, celluloid recorder held behind
his back, leaned forward on his toes to get a clear
view over Oulds’ head. Tom Locke toed the
slab.</p>

<p>“Git th’ fust one, boy!” roared a voice from
the crowd. “Show what y’ c’n do. Breeze
him!”</p>

<p>The tall young man on the mound gave a shake
of his head as he tossed back a lock of brown
hair. His clean-cut face was a bit pale, and he
seemed somewhat nervous, which was not strange,
considering his apparent youth and the nature
of the tumultuous, rough-and-ready crowd whose
eyes were fastened upon him. He wore a glove
on his right hand, and it was his cleat-tipped
right shoe that touched the slab. Leaning forward,
he nodded a bit as he caught the catcher’s
signal, swinging immediately into his delivery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>“Ball!” bellowed the umpire, as the sphere
went shooting over, high and wide, a white streak
in the air.</p>

<p>“Aw-w, get ’em down!” brayed the coacher
back of first, while the one on the opposite side of
the diamond whooped derisively, and the batter,
having flung a glance skyward, grinned in a taunting
way. “He ain’t on stilts. He can’t reach
’em in the clouds,” added the coacher.</p>

<p>“Stiddy, boy,” gurgled Oulds, returning the
ball. “Make him hit.”</p>

<p>That first wide one brought a mocking shout
from the Bancroft bunch on the bleachers, and
apparently Locke grew still more nervous, for his
second pitch forced Harney to do a lively dodge
to avoid being bored in the ribs.</p>

<p>“Ball tuh!”</p>

<p>“Wow-wow!” barked one coacher. “He’s
wild as mountain scenery.”</p>

<p>“Take a ramble, Cap; he’ll walk ye,” cried the
other coacher.</p>

<p>The Bancroft rooters scoffed again; the Kingsbridge
crowd was anxiously silent.</p>

<p>“Never mind that, kid,” soothed Oulds. “Take
your time; don’t hurry. Make him hit.”</p>

<p>The backstop returning the ball, Locke attempted
to catch it with his gloved hand, dropped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
it, turned hastily, struck it with his toe, and sent
it rolling toward second.</p>

<p>Larry Stark, covering that sack, sprang after
the sphere, scooped it up, and held it in both
hands against his chest while stepping swiftly
toward the pitcher to speak a few low, reassuring
words. Then he tossed the ball, and danced
back to his position.</p>

<p>There was no doubt about it now; plainly Locke
was nervous. Seeing this, the coachers and the
visiting spectators did what they could to rattle
him. Even though he tried to steady himself, the
next ball from his fingers whiffed up a pop of
dust two feet in front of the plate.</p>

<p>“Ball three!”</p>

<p>“The ascension begins early to-day,” laughed
the coacher near third; and the Bancrofters behind
him began to sing: “Up in a Balloon,
Boys.”</p>

<p>On the home bench, Manager Hutchinson
leaned forward, his elbow on his knee, his hand
propping his chin, eyes narrowed and fixed on
the disturbed pitcher.</p>

<p>Standing behind the bench, Henry Cope removed
his old straw hat to mop his bald head and
flushed face, trying all the while to preserve a
calm and confident smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>The crowd in the stand and along the right
side of the field stirred restlessly. Murmurs
were heard: “What’s the matter with him?”
“Punk!” “Rotten!” “He can’t find the
plate!” “He’s no good!”</p>

<p>“Take your time, Locke,” begged Captain
Stark. “Don’t hurry. Put it straight over, and
let him hit. We’re behind you.”</p>

<p>Harney, sneering, twiddled his bat and made
a bluff of turning his back to the plate. Although
he did not turn, his indifferent pose spoke his disdain
and belief that he would receive a pass.</p>

<p>The assurance was justified. Seeking to get a
grip on himself, Tom Locke strove to whip over a
straight one. Then—</p>

<p>“Take y’ur base!” croaked the umpire as the
horsehide plunked into Oulds’ reaching mitt.</p>

<small>“TAKE HIM OUT!”</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Flinging his club toward the bench, Harney
jogged lazily down the line, grinning
into the faces of the dissatisfied and sullen
Kingsbridgers on the bleachers. The chortling
coacher hailed him hilariously:</p>

<p>“Too bad! Too bad! That pudding is scared
stiff. He won’t last an innin’. Back to the pastures
for him.”</p>

<p>The murmurs of the home crowd became
louder: “Who ever heard of him, anyhow?”
“He can’t pitch!” “Who picked him up?”
“He’s Hen Cope’s find.” “What’s old Cope
know about baseball?” “That dub never saw a
real game before.”</p>

<p>Cope put a hand on Hutchinson’s shoulder.
“The boy’ll settle down in a minute,” he said,
trying to speak in a confident and undisturbed
way. “He’s just a bit shaky to start with, but
he’ll git into gear soon.”</p>

<p>“He’d better—in a hurry,” retorted the manager
in that same dead-level, colorless voice.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
“Four straight balls to begin a game is some
rotten pitching.”</p>

<p>“I don’t s’pose he’s uster this sort of a crowd,”
admitted Cope apologetically, coming round and
seating himself beside Hutchinson. “He’s a gentleman,
and he’s usually played with—er—well,
gentlemanly comp’ny.”</p>

<p>“He’s out of his element here. This is real
baseball, played by scrappers who are ready to
fight every inch of the way. Tell me, Mr. Cope,
where did you discover that worthless piece of
excess baggage?”</p>

<p>The elder man’s face became still redder.
“Never you mind about that. I’ve watched his
record, and it’s a good one. I didn’t buy no pig
in a poke. Didn’t he stop Fryeburg arter Deever
blew up?”</p>

<p>“They’re marks. Deever made monkeys of
them until his sore wing pegged out. Anybody
with a straight ball and a little speed could have
held ’em.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe so: but, all the same, I know this feller
can pitch.”</p>

<p>“If he don’t show some signs of it pretty soon,
I’ll bench him and send Skillings in.”</p>

<p>“Now, you give him a show; you give him a
chance. He’ll straighten out, and show you somethin’.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
I’m backin’ him, and I want you to listen
to me.”</p>

<p>“I had an idea,” said Hutchinson icily, “that
I was engaged to manage this team.”</p>

<p>“You was, but I’ve got somethin’ to say, and I
insist that that boy has a good, square show.”</p>

<p>“Ball!”</p>

<p>Andy Trollop, following Harney at bat, stood
lounging, with the club on his shoulder, and
watched the first wide one pass, laughing as
Oulds, reaching, growled beneath his breath.</p>

<p>“If you try to stop ’em all, Hunchy,” said
Andy, with pretended solicitude, “you’ll strain
yourself, and have a doctor’s bill to pay. Better
let ’em go to the net.”</p>

<p>“You go to blazes!” retorted Oulds; which
caused Andy to laugh still more.</p>

<p>Instead of throwing the ball to Locke, the
catcher suddenly lined it to first base, causing
Harney to lunge back under Hinkey’s arm to the
sack.</p>

<p>Then Oulds removed his mask, and pretended
to fuss with the elastic strap, which gave Stark
an opportunity to run up to the pitcher and softly
urge him to go slow and force Trollop to swing.</p>

<p>“He thinks you can’t get ’em over,” whispered
the captain, “and mebbe he won’t strike at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
first one or two you put across. Keep it close,
and take a chance. Don’t use a bender till you
have to. Now, do steady down, son.”</p>

<p>Locke’s only reply was a nod. His lips were
pressed together, and his face was gray. He
could hear the crowd growling everywhere save
in the section occupied by the laughing, scoffing
Bancrofters; try as he might, he could not deafen
his ears to those unpleasant sounds.</p>

<p>“Play ball!” yelled a coacher.</p>

<p>“Play ball, and stop chewin’ the rag,” roared a
man from the third-base bleachers. “I come here
to see a game.”</p>

<p>“Don’t look like you’d see much of a one to-day,”
said another man. “I’d like to git my
money back now.”</p>

<p>Hinkey tossed the ball to Locke. The youngster
was deliberate enough in his movements, but
still, seeking to put a straight one over on the
inside, he compelled the second batter to make a
hasty get-away. Oulds popped up from behind
the batsman, ready to throw, but Harney had
taken no chances.</p>

<p>“Don’t have to do it with this duck pitchin’,”
laughed the captain of the Bullies. “He’ll walk
us all. It’s a shame.”</p>

<p>Now not a few of the local players were beginning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
to betray annoyance and disgust, and the
complaints of the home crowd grew louder.
Henry Cope perspired from every pore; but Bob
Hutchinson, still with his palm propping his chin,
his cold eyes fixed on Locke, did not stir. The
harassed pitcher walked in a small, complete
circle round the slab.</p>

<p>“Say eeny, meeny, miney, mo, Lefty,” advised
one of the coachers. “That’ll sure break the hoodoo.”</p>

<p>“For the love of Mike, do put one over!” entreated
a Kingsbridger piteously—so piteously
that a few, who had not permitted their sufferings
wholly to rob them of their sense of humor,
laughed.</p>

<p>But Locke actually handed up the seventh
straight ball in succession! This despite the fact
that he had never tried harder in all his life to
find the plate.</p>

<p>The clamor swelled; the crowd began to hurl
insults at the unfortunate twirler. The Bancroft
players, waiting on the bench to bat, were choking
with laughter. One coacher did monkey-shines,
and the other pretended to weep, boring his
knuckles into his eyes and bellowing lustily.</p>

<p>Oulds held the ball until ordered to throw it, by
the umpire. Locke made a two-handed muff of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
that easy toss, and the insults came thicker. Harney,
dancing off first, sought to draw a throw,
knowing the pitcher in his present state of mind
might put the ball into the bleachers.</p>

<p>Locke did throw to first, but he took so much
care that the runner was lounging on the sack
when Hinkey got the sphere.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t throw out a sick cat in four million
years, Lefty,” mocked the coacher.</p>

<p>The local players looked at Captain Stark;
Stark looked at Hutchinson on the bench; Hutchinson
did not move a muscle.</p>

<p>“Don’t delay the game,” begged Harney.
“Let the lobster pitch, if you’re going to.”</p>

<p>Skillings, chewing gum, in anticipation of the
call every one seemed to believe must come directly,
was keeping his arm limbered by throwing
to Deever, the latter sparing his sore wing by tossing
the sphere back with his left hand.</p>

<p>Locke’s forehead was knotted as he once more
toed the slab. This time he came near getting
the ball across, but it missed the corner by an inch,
and the umpire, now back of the pitcher, made a
sweeping signal with his left arm for Trollop to
go down.</p>

<p>“Here we go round the mulberry bush,” sang
Harney, jogging to second; but his words were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
drowned by the catcalls, whoops, and jeers of the
spectators.</p>

<p>“Oh, you left-handed lobster!”</p>

<p>“You’re on the blink!”</p>

<p>“Go die somewhere!”</p>

<p>“You can’t pitch!”</p>

<p>“You never could pitch!”</p>

<p>“Take it away and bury it!”</p>

<p>“Chase yourself, you skate!”</p>

<p>Eight balls without a break had Tom Locke
thrown, passing the first two men to face him.
And this was the great southpaw man Kingsbridge
had heard so much about lately, the left-handed
wizard who was to make the hated Bullies
bite the dust!</p>

<p>“Take him out!” shrieked a voice above the
clamor.</p>

<p>Instantly the crowd took it up on all sides.
“Take him out!” they roared. “Take him out!
Take him out!”</p>

<p>Bob Hutchinson lifted his chin from his hand,
sat up straight, and turned to Henry Cope.</p>

<p>“Well?” he said.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br>
<small>HIMSELF AGAIN</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Among the spectators, doubtless, the performance
of Tom Locke gave no one
keener disappointment and chagrin than
that experienced by Janet Harting. She almost
writhed, her fair forehead knotted and her rosy
mouth puckering and pouting. Once she stood up,
but the horses, possibly getting a glimpse of her
parasol, started, and young King, quieting them,
suggested that it would be best for her to remain
on the seat.</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t it just mean!” the girl cried, as
Locke continued to search in vain for the pan.
“Everybody expected him to do so much. Mr.
Cope was so sure about him, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” said Bent. “For the last few
days the whole town has been talking about the
wonderful new pitcher and what he would do.”</p>

<p>“It’s a shame! Why, he can’t pitch at all!”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem so, but perhaps he may steady
down. I once saw a pitcher pass three men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
straight, and then strike out the next three without
a break.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but this one never could do a thing like
that. He can’t put even a straight one over; he
hasn’t a bit of control.”</p>

<p>“You talk like a fan, Janet. Your father is
such a crank—er, excuse me!—that he wouldn’t
let you see the games last year. Where did you
pick up your knowledge?”</p>

<p>“Boarding school. Some of us girls used to
get to the college games on Saturday. I declare,
I do believe he’s going to walk this batter, too!
Why don’t they take him out and let some one
pitch who knows how?”</p>

<p>“There’s Cope talking to the manager on the
bench. The old man is stubborn, and I presume
he’s set on giving the great pitcher he signed all
the show possible. It hurts his pride to see the
fellow fizzle this way.”</p>

<p>Janet’s blue eyes flashed. “It’s simply dreadful!”
she panted. “Every day last year I got
the score of the games, and it made me ill when
our team went to pieces at last, the way it did.
And everybody has been saying we’d surely beat
Bancroft this year. Hear them mocking us over
there! Oh, I’m sorry I came to-day!”</p>

<p>“Cheer up; the game isn’t lost just because a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
false alarm is unmasking himself in the first inning.
The home crowd is getting hot now, and
they’ll demand that the fellow be benched directly.
We’ve got other pitchers, you know.”</p>

<p>“Other pitchers! Don’t call this one a pitcher!
He’s a—a—”</p>

<p>“A flash in the pan,” laughed King. “It’s a
good thing he has betrayed himself right off the
reel, for that will give us all the more time to recover
from the shock. There, there goes the second
batter to first. Now hear the crowd rub it into
the poor dub. Oh, say! they’re soaking him.
There’ll be a riot if he isn’t sent to the stable
pretty quick. Listen to that! I knew it!”</p>

<p>The exasperated Kingsbridgers were howling
for the removal of Locke, the cry to take him out
immediately swelling into a roar from all sides of
the field. Forgetting the cautioning words of
her companion, Miss Harting again sprang to her
feet.</p>

<p>“Take him out!” she cried; but her voice was
drowned in the mighty volume of sound.</p>

<p>“Steady, Janet,” said Bent, taking hold of her
arm with one hand and gently drawing her back
to the seat. “This racket is making the nags
nervous, and I’d hate to spill you out, after promising
your grudging father to look after you and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
see that nothing happened. They’ll have to put
the blanket on Lefty now. The crowd won’t stand
for any more of him.”</p>

<p>On the Kingsbridge bench Henry Cope and
Manager Hutchinson were arguing over it, the
former hot and insistent, the latter cold and unemotionally
scornful.</p>

<p>“One chance more—give him another show,”
demanded Cope. “I tell ye I <em>know</em> he can pitch.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he can pitch hay,” returned Hutchinson;
“but not baseball. Listen to that howling
mob. They’ll murder him pretty quick. I don’t
want the responsibility on my shoulders.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take all the responsibility; he’s my man,
and I’ll shoulder it. Let him try the next feller.”</p>

<p>“When the whole town gets to kicking at me,
will you stand up and say you insisted on it
against my wishes?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I jest say I’d shoulder it! Nobody
shan’t put the blame on you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right. They’ll mob him on the diamond
if he hands out another pass, and that’s just
what he’ll do. He’s white as a ghost with fear.
He couldn’t get the ball over now if his life depended
on it.”</p>

<p>Indeed, the wretched pitcher was ghastly white,
the pallor of his face making his dark-brown eyes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
seem almost black; and into the depths of those
eyes had come a light like a dull-red flame, flaring
up swiftly.</p>

<p>A few moments before he had felt his own
nerves unsteady, and fought in vain for control of
them; now, with the howling demand for his removal
hammering into his ears, he suddenly found
himself steady as a foundation rock. His resentment
and anger was of the white-hot variety that
transmutes. A man serene and calm it might unnerve;
one doubtful and wavering it might turn
to iron.</p>

<p>Slowly he turned until he had faced every side
of the field, and all that mass of snarling humanity,
yelling at him, jeering, insulting, shaking their
fists, their faces red and wroth, their eyes full
of contempt, their lips hurling forth threats of
bodily violence—and he smiled at them.</p>

<p>“Howl away,” he said, but no one save himself
heard the words. “I’ll show you some pitching
yet.”</p>

<p>Never before had he pitched in the presence of
a crowd of such crude, seemingly ferocious, human
beings; but many a time, as he well knew, he
had faced batters as skillful and dangerous as
these raw, would-be professionals and broken-down
cast-offs from minor leagues.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>At no time had he feared the hitting ability of
his opponents, but, as sometimes happens to the
headiest and most seasoned veteran, the moment
he toed the slab some incomprehensible thing had
taken possession of him, and made him a mockery
for the crowd and a sickening shame to himself.</p>

<p>Now, however, he knew the unmanning spirit
had been exorcised; he was himself again, clean
and fit.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br>
<small>STEADYING DOWN</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Tom Locke did not turn his eyes toward
the bench; he did not dare, lest a glance
should be interpreted as a supplication,
and bring about his removal from the field. He
saw Oulds, ball in hand, standing squarely on the
plate, while “Wop” Grady, the next batter, eager
to keep things going and gain as much advantage
for Bancroft as possible before another pitcher
was sent in, was seeking to push him back into
his position.</p>

<p>His manner entirely changed, although his face
continued ashen, Locke beckoned to the catcher,
and ran forward. Oulds, scowling, sour, sullen,
met him five feet in front of the pan.</p>

<p>“Give me that ball,” said Locke, taking it from
the catcher’s hand. “Call the curves: a drop or a
high inshoot for a strike-out, whichever you happen
to know this man is weakest on. I’m going
to get him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are!” sneered Oulds. “Why, you
can’t—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>“Get ready to catch me,” Locke cut him short.
“I tell you I’m going to get this man.”</p>

<p>Then, seemingly deaf to the continued howling
of the crowd, he turned and walked back, apparently
disregarding the taunting base runners, who
were dancing off the sacks to lure a throw.</p>

<p>Larry Stark, doubtless wondering that Hutchinson
had not signaled for a change, stood listless,
twelve feet off second; but, without betraying the
fact, Locke observed that Jim Sockamore, the Indian
center fielder, apparently hoping to work an
old trick in the midst of the excitement, was walking
swiftly, but unobtrusively, in toward the
sack. Indeed, Sockamore was not twenty feet
from the bag when the pitcher faced Grady at the
plate.</p>

<p>Only for an instant were Locke’s eyes turned toward
the batsman; like a flash, he whirled again
to face second, and the ball shot from his fingers
as he turned.</p>

<p>He had not received a signal to throw, but he did
so on the chance that the foxy Indian player would
sneak all the way to the hassock, if for no other
purpose than to show up what might have been
pulled off with a live pitcher on the slab.</p>

<p>Sockamore was within five feet of the cushion
when Locke turned, and, seeing the ball was coming,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
he leaped forward. Harney, not a little surprised,
lunged back. Like a bullet the scarcely
soiled ball sped straight into the eager hands of
the young redskin, who met Harney and jabbed it
on to him viciously as the Bancroft captain weakly
sought to slip under.</p>

<p>The howling of the angry and dissatisfied crowd
was instantly cut short. The sudden silence was
ruptured by a single hoarse word shot from the
lips of the umpire, who had been so surprised that
for a moment he had faltered in giving the decision:</p>

<p>“Out!”</p>

<p>The spectators gasped; Harney choked and
rumbled weakly. Sockamore grinned into the face
of the tricked and chagrined man. At the bench,
Henry Cope brought his hand down with a resounding
slap upon his thigh, crying jubilantly:</p>

<p>“There! He got him!”</p>

<p>After a few moments of dazed silence, some
scattered persons ventured to applaud and cheer
faintly, while, apparently struck by the seeming
incongruity of the unexpected performance, many
others laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, what an accident!” groaned one of the
coachers, as Harney, his face red with mortification,
rose to his feet and gave Locke a stare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>“How’d you ever happen to think of it?”
sneered the Bancroft captain.</p>

<p>Chuckling, Sockamore threw the ball to the
pitcher, and capered back into center field. Harney,
his mouth twisted and his cheeks burning,
made slowly for the Bancroft bench.</p>

<p>“Accidents will happen,” came from a coacher.
“Never mind that. Take a constitutional, Wop;
he’ll accommodate ye.”</p>

<p>Grady idled at the pan, laughing silently over
the discomfiture of his captain. He was still
idling when Locke, seeing Oulds ready, shot over
a scorcher that clipped the inside corner.</p>

<p>“Strike!” declared the umpire.</p>

<p>“What’s that? What’s that?” cried the
coacher. “It can’t be poss-i-bill? Another accident!”</p>

<p>Surprise was general, but still, like the coacher,
the spectators on the bleachers and in the stand
fancied it related in a way to something “accidental,”
and not one in a hundred thought it probable
that the left-hander could put over another without
wasting several.</p>

<p>Oulds, wondering, called for an out-drop, but
Locke, knowing the batter had not yet been egged
into a condition that would make him easy to
“pull,” shook his head. The signal was changed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
to one requesting a straight drop, and the pitcher
swung into a snappy, quick delivery.</p>

<p>The ball seemed to be too high, and not looking
for the despised twirler to “put much on it,”
Grady permitted himself to be caught again.
Down past his shoulders shot the sphere, to the instant
croaking of “Strike tuh!” from the umpire.</p>

<p>“Hey, hey! What’s comin’ off here?” bellowed
an uncoated, unshaven, collarless man back
of first base. “Lightnin’s hit agin in the same
place.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br>
<small>SOME PITCHING!</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">There was a change in the aspect of the
crowd and its behavior, for this was more
like something worth while, and a few
were beginning to think it possible they might
have underestimated the ability of the southpaw
slabman. Yet, lost confidence had not been
wholly restored, and they waited to see what the
final result would be, the Kingsbridgers silent,
the Bancroft crowd still laughing and scoffing.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Wop,” called the coacher at third.
“He can’t do it agin. If he does, give it a ride.
Come on, Trollop; git off that mattress—tear
yourself free. On your toes! Ready to scorch
if Wop biffs it. Git away, away, away off! More
than that! I’ll watch the ball. Come on! Come
on!”</p>

<p>Locke drove Trollop back to the sack once, following
which he quickly pitched the third ball to
Grady. He had a way of throwing every one in
almost precisely the same manner, which prevented
a batter from judging what was coming by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
his style of delivery. It looked like another high
one that might turn into a drop, but it proved to
be a fancy inshoot, and Grady, doing his prettiest
to connect, made a clean miss.</p>

<p>“Y’u’re out!” barked the umpire.</p>

<p>Then the crowd did cheer, for, in amazing contrast
to the manner in which he had opened up,
Tom Locke had whiffed Grady without wasting
one.</p>

<p>Henry Cope poked the silent Hutchinson in the
ribs. “What’d I tell ye? What’d I tell ye?” he
spluttered delightedly. “Now I guess you’ll see
I ain’t such a bonehead in pickin’ pitchers. I
played this game myself once.”</p>

<p>“Wait,” said the manager without a flutter, or
the slightest variation of intonation. “Strikin’
out one man that’s looking to walk don’t make a
pitcher. He’s got to show me more’n that.”</p>

<p>“He’ll show ye, all right,” asserted Cope. “I
knew what he c’d do.”</p>

<p>Gus Mace followed Grady at the pan. The
right fielder of the Bullies, he was regarded as
their heaviest hitter, and his batting the year before
had caused the Kingsbridgers to groan with
grief. He was boiling over with confidence as he
faced Locke, but, getting a signal from Riley, he
let the first one pass, in order that Trollop, grown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
weary of camping on first, might try to steal.</p>

<p>It was a strike, and Oulds winged it to second in
the effort to nail the runner, who had made a
flying start and was burning up the ground.
Trollop slid, spikes first, and Stark, who seemed
to have him nipped, dropped the sphere in the attempt
to avoid those spikes and tag the man at
the same time. Trollop was safe.</p>

<p>“Now’s the time, Mace!” cried the coacher back
of third. “Hit it out. Give it a long sail, and let
Andy walk home.” He had dropped his chatter
about waiting for a pass.</p>

<p>Mace gripped his trusty war club and waited,
crouching a little. It was plain that the Kinks’
new pitcher had recovered his control, and the
batter meant to hit anything that came across.
He struck left-handed, and the next one pitched
looked good to him. It dragged him almost across
the pan, and he did not even foul it lightly.</p>

<p>A sharp yell went up from the once-more vibrant
and excited crowd, but this time it was a yell
of satisfaction. Choking, agitated men began to
predict that Lefty would fan Mace, also.</p>

<p>“If he does,” said one, “I’m goin’ to throw a
fit right here! I’ll own up honest that I’m the
biggest fool that ever barked like a sore-eared
pup at a good man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>The Bancrofters were still trying hard to rattle
Locke, but now, absolutely cool, self-possessed,
and confident, he gave no more heed to their racket
than he might to the buzzing of a single fly.
There was something in his clean-cut face, his
steady eyes, firm mouth, and deliberate manner
which proclaimed him absolute master of himself,
and predicted that he also would show himself
master of the situation.</p>

<p>Oulds, his confidence completely restored,
grinned through the meshes of the wire mask. “I
reckon you was jest monkeyin’ with ’em boy,”
he said. “They’ll all look alike to ye from now
on. This one’s jest as easy as any.”</p>

<p>And so it proved, for Big Mace slashed again,
and found nothing but empty air; whereupon the
Kingsbridge crowd rose in a body and roared a
splendid salvo for the man they had been reviling
and threatening a short time before.</p>

<p>As that burst of applause died away, a Neapolitan
laborer, standing on the bleachers, his shirt
open at the throat, the oily, blue-black hair of his
bared head shining in the sun, his kindled eyes almost
popping, and his teeth flashing like scimitars,
shook his grimy fists in the air, and screamed:</p>

<p>“What’s-a da mat’ with-a da Lefty?”</p>

<p>The answer was a great shout of laughter, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
another hearty round of applause, which told how
suddenly and completely the humor of that recently
raging and reviling assemblage had altered.
He whom a few minutes before they were deriding
and threatening, had, by his amazing performance,
become the admired idol of the moment, the
Horatius at the bridge, the Moses to find the promised
land.</p>

<p>They were more than willing to accept him as
king of warriors and savior of wilderness wanderers,
but to retain his scepter he must still further
demonstrate his prowess in battle or his ability to
smite a dry-shod pathway across a mythical Red
Sea.</p>

<small>A PITCHERS’ BATTLE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">As Locke walked calmly toward the bench
he found Captain Stark at his side, laughing.
“You pulled outer that hole in
great shape, old man,” said Larry; “but you sure
had us all leery to start with. I reckoned you was
plumb up in the air.”</p>

<p>“I was,” admitted the pitcher unhesitatingly;
“but I managed to get my feet under me after a
while.”</p>

<p>His face was no longer pale; the color had returned
to his cheeks, and a flickering smile played
at the corners of his fine mouth.</p>

<p>Henry Cope, beaming, made room for the players
on the bench. “I knowed it,” he said. “I
tole ’em so.”</p>

<p>Having unemotionally watched the new pitcher
approach, Manager Hutchinson spoke to Stark.
“See if you can’t start something right away,”
he directed. “Mebbe we’ll get ’em going if we
score the first time up.”</p>

<p>Larry nodded, and whispered hastily to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
leading batter, Labelle, a slim, shifty French
Canadian, a heady single hitter, and an unusually
fast man on the sacks. Labelle grinned, and found
his bat.</p>

<p>Possibly the Bancroft manager was more disgusted
than disappointed, as the sarcastic comments
which he flung at his offending players
seemed to indicate; but as yet he had not been
aroused to apprehension concerning the ultimate
outcome of the game, and he felt that, were the
Kinks’ left-hander really formidable, it had well
happened that his men had been forwarned thus
early in the contest.</p>

<p>Having relieved his feelings by a flaying fling
at Mace, as the final victim of Locke’s skill secured
his fielding mitt from the bench, Riley cast
aside the remnants of his cigar, lighted a fresh
weed, and prepared to watch Jock Hoover make
monkeys of the locals.</p>

<p>Janet Harting was overjoyed. “Oh, wasn’t
that splendid!” she cried, impulsively squeezing
her companion’s arm with one gloved hand. “It
was <em>such</em> a surprise! I never expected it.”</p>

<p>“No more did any one, I fancy,” said King,
laughing. “It’s the unexpected that so frequently
happens which makes baseball the fascinating
game it is. Apparently that fellow can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
pitch some, after all. I wonder where he came
from.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Cope won’t tell, and nobody around here
seems to know.”</p>

<p>“Somehow I have a feeling that I’ve seen him
before, but I can’t place him.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’s some great college pitcher,” said
the girl.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that, but if he is I reckon
he’s here under a fake name; for you know it
makes college twirlers professionals to play for
money. A man is barred if he’s ever caught
at it. Just the same, some of them, needing the
dough, take the risk. Up here in this league a
man would stand a fair chance of getting by without
being exposed.”</p>

<p>“It’s—it’s supposed to be dishonest, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but necessity has driven more than one
good man to shut his eyes to that phase of the
matter. If this Locke was known at all as a professional,
some of the players of this league
should recognize him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like to think that he’s a college man
who would do such a thing,” said Janet earnestly.</p>

<p>“Oh-ho!” cried Bent. “So you’re taking considerable
interest in the chap you thought couldn’t
pitch at all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” she faltered, “he—he looks clean and
honest. One can see he isn’t like the others—the
most of them, anyway. Kingsbridge is going to
bat now. I hope they can do something.”</p>

<p>Hoover had shaken the kinks out of his arm by
two or three throws to first, and, glancing round
to make sure his backers were in position and
ready, he stepped on to the slab and glowered at
Labelle. Squatting, Bangs signaled, and the fire-eating
twirler swung into his first delivery.</p>

<p>Although a “waiter,” with an excellent eye,
Labelle seldom permitted himself to pass up the
first one if it came over the rubber, and he sought
to land on Hoover’s corner-cutting slant. The
resulting foul counted against the batter as a
strike.</p>

<p>“That’s a nibble; take a bite,” shouted a
coacher.</p>

<p>Labelle stamped his spikes into the ground, and
squared himself again, unruffled. Hoover leered
at him vindictively. The crowd rooted.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br>
<small>ON THE RAW EDGE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Two balls followed swiftly, the batter ignoring
them both, although with every nerve
taut.</p>

<p>“Got to put ’em over, Jocko,” called the
coacher. “You can’t pull that little Canuck.”</p>

<p>Hoover handed up a “spitter,” and Labelle
missed cleanly.</p>

<p>“He never could touch you,” chuckled the first
baseman.</p>

<p>“You’ve got his measure,” declared the shortstop.</p>

<p>“Give him another in the same place,” urged
the guardian of third.</p>

<p>“Oh, let him hit,” begged the center fielder.
“He won’t get it out of the diamond.”</p>

<p>Again, and once again, the Canadian fouled;
and then Hoover caught him with a deceptive
slant for another clean miss, and Labelle retired,
disappointed.</p>

<p>Stark came next, and, like the leading sticker,
his best efforts resulted only in weak fouls, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
Bully on the slab finally sending him back to the
bench by the whiff route, to the loud acclaim of
the admiring Bancrofters on the bleachers.</p>

<p>“They’ll never locate you to-day, Jock,”
shouted one of these. “Show up their southpaw
wizard. Make a record.”</p>

<p>Reddy Crandall proved to be quite as easy as
his predecessors, and Hoover finished his first
turn with the third straight strike-out, not even
seeming to hear the wild applause of his admirers
as he sauntered, sour and unsmiling, to
the bench.</p>

<p>More than one of those admirers, even while
fulsome with praise, had sometimes felt a strong
desire to kick the ungrateful, egotistical, pugnacious
star slabman of the champions, who,
among his browbeating teammates, even, was not
much courted for his society off the field.</p>

<p>Riley, the only person who never praised or
flattered him, had discovered some secret process
of holding him in check and making him of inestimable
value to the team.</p>

<p>“Now, you fellers,” growled the Bancroft
manager, speaking with the cigar between his
teeth, “I want ye t’ go after this left-handed dub,
and chaw him up. Put the willer to him, and
break his heart. You had him almost out when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
you slipped a cog t’other time. Git to first,
McGovern, and th’ boys will push ye round.”</p>

<p>“I’ll make the sack somehow,” promised McGovern,
as he started out with his big bat, conquest
in his heart.</p>

<p>Exactly thirty-two seconds later Pat McGovern
came back to the bench, fanned, having found his
left-handed position at the plate most disadvantageous
in batting against the Kinks’ southpaw.
Riley was growling throatily as Otto Bernsteine
went forth to pit his wits and skill against the
brains and cleverness of Tom Locke.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, Bernsteine, although usually
phlegmatic and unemotional, was worried; for he,
also, hit left-handed, and he had begun to believe
that the Kingsbridge twirler was a terror to
batters who stood at the plate in that manner.
His worriment was justified; Locke got him, also.</p>

<p>The uproar of the crowd drowned the remarks
of one Michael Riley, manager of the Bancrofts;
and this may have spared the nerves of any sensitive
person in his immediate vicinity. “Hey,
Lisotte,” he snarled at the shortstop, who was the
next in line, “bunt the ball. D’ye hear? Bunt,
an’ try to beat it out. You bat wrong, too, and
ye can’t hit him fair. He’s got the Injun sign
on you off-side sluggers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>Lisotte did his best, but the first ball he bunted
rolled foul, and the next he tried for, being close
and high, was missed completely. Fearing to
try another bunt, he finally swung after one that
came slanting over, and missed that also.</p>

<p>The best stickers of the Bullies had faced
Locke in two innings, and not one had obtained
as much as a scratch single off him; realizing
which, the local crowd had spasms of many sorts.
With faith completely restored, the Kingsbridgers
were telling one another exultantly that, at last,
the man had been found to hold the hated enemy
in check. Visions of the Northern League pennant
waving over their grand stand at the finish
of the season already danced before their eyes.</p>

<p>The Bancrofters, although saying that the game
was young, and pretending their confidence was
as great as ever, were really suffering the qualms
of apprehension, all the more intense and disturbing
because of the early elation they had
felt.</p>

<p>When Kingsbridge’s Italian right fielder, Tony
Anastace, opened the second for the locals with a
clean safety, this rejoicing on one side and apprehension
on the other was redoubled.</p>

<p>But Jack Hinkey popped to the infield, Anastace
was slaughtered trying to purloin second,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
and Fred Lace lifted a high foul back of third
for Wop Grady to smother, squaring things up
with not a count for either side.</p>

<p>Although Locke, feeling that he had the confidence
of his teammates at last, seemed to take it
easier, a measly scratch single was all Bancroft
could find him for in the third; and, with Hoover
hitting a two-minute clip in the last of the same
inning, even the least astute spectator understood
that it was practically certain to be a pitchers’
battle right through to the finish.</p>

<p>With the passing of the innings, and the failure
of his teammates to score, Hoover steadily became
more savage in the box. At times, under
cover of the shouting of the crowd, he insulted
the batters with venomous, blood-tingling words.</p>

<p>Contrary to his usual practice, he sought the
privilege of going on to the coaching line, where
his sneers and slurs were of a nature that aroused
protests from the crowd, and finally forced Riley
to keep him on the bench when he was idle.</p>

<p>Locke opened the sixth by fanning Trollop,
Grady, and Mace, one after another; and then,
in the final half, he came first to bat for Kingsbridge.</p>

<p>“Get back off the pan, you peanut-headed
sample of nature’s carelessness,” rasped Hoover,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
ready to pitch. “Get back, or I’ll take a rib outer
yer!”</p>

<p>“I’m in my box,” returned Locke calmly.
“Pitch the ball, sorehead.”</p>

<p>With a murderous expression, Hoover scorched
one straight at his rival, and Tom barely escaped
being hit by a most amazing, lightninglike dodge.
This brought the Kingsbridge crowd up howling
wrathfully, and Locke, recovering his position
at the pan, cried loudly enough for Hoover to
hear:</p>

<p>“Try it again, old boy—try it again, and they’ll
be coming after you with war clubs and scalping
knives.”</p>

<p>Captain Harney ran out and grabbed Hoover.
“Keep your head, Jock—keep your head,” he
begged. “He’s won the crowd. He’s got ’em
with him. You’ll start a fight that’ll mean busted
heads if you hit him on purpose.”</p>

<p>Already two constables, wearing their badges
displayed, were having their hands full to keep
back a few hot-headed ones, who seemed eager to
charge upon the diamond to reach Hoover.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br>
<small>THE “SQUEEZE PLAY”</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">In a town like Kingsbridge, such a movement
meant a general stampede, followed by a
riot, in which more than one participant
would “get his.”</p>

<p>Harney continued to talk to Hoover until the
raging pitcher, the freckles on his face seeming
to stand out like innumerable islands in a grayish
sea, promised to behave. The umpire seemed
practically helpless.</p>

<p>Locke had waited quietly. He gripped his bat,
and squared away as he saw Hoover making
ready. The ball came over the outside corner
with a shoot, and Tom met it. It was a beautiful,
clean single into right field.</p>

<p>The crowd was still roaring when Labelle
rushed forth to the pan, signaling that he would
attempt a sacrifice. Locke was on his toes, and
ready, and he started as Hoover began his short
delivery. True to his signaled promise, the
Canadian dropped a bunt in front of the pan, thus
easily giving the runner ahead of him second, although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
he himself was cut down in his last jump
for first.</p>

<p>With one out, a runner on second, and Captain
Larry Stark ready to wield the willow, the local
crowd whooped it up like crazy Indians at a ghost
dance, believing Kingsbridge had its chance to
score.</p>

<p>It was plain that the new pitcher, besides being
fast on his feet and ready to take chances, had
the faculty of leaping away almost at top speed
with his first stride or two, and a long, clean single
might enable him to score from second.</p>

<p>Hoover knew this, and was inwardly disturbed.
Although he had already twice cut Stark down
at the pan, previous experiences warned him that,
as a batter to advance runners, the cool, heady,
sure-eyed Kingsbridge captain was far more
dangerous than the heavier-hitting Crandall, who
followed him. Therefore, being supported by a
sign from the bench, Jock decided to pass Larry,
and take his chances with Crandall and Anastace.</p>

<p>First driving Locke back twice to second, but
being unable to keep him hugging the cushion,
Hoover handed up a wide one with such elaborate
method that he betrayed his purpose immediately.</p>

<p>Promptly with the next pitch, something happened:
Locke was leaping away toward third<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
before the ball left Jock’s fingers. Grady covered
the sack, and Bangs scorched the air with his
quick line throw, but the runner slipped under, and
was safe by a narrow margin. Bill Harney disputed
the decision, while the crowd howled; but
the umpire waved him back to first.</p>

<p>Eyes bulging, throats dry, nerves twitching, the
Kingsbridge spectators rooted for a run. Some
were purple-faced and perspiring; others were
pale and cold; all were wrought to the highest
pitch of expectation and excitement.</p>

<p>The face of the wrothy Hoover was twisted into
a snarl, and, as the ball came back to him, he betrayed
momentary indecision.</p>

<p>Immediately Locke caught a signal from Stark,
given by the Kingsbridge captain with his back
toward third, his attention seemingly focused on
the man on the slab, and the runner knew Larry
would seek to hit the next pitched ball if he could
possibly reach it without stepping out of the box.
Crouching like a runner ready for the crack of the
starter’s pistol, Locke crept off third.</p>

<p>The ball was wide of the rubber, but, reaching
far across, Stark found it with the end of his long
bat, and tapped it into the diamond, immediately
getting away on the jump for first.</p>

<p>Locke had not failed to obey the signal for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
“squeeze,” and he was coming like the wind
when the bat and ball met. Hoover forked fruitlessly
at the ball as it caracoled past, but it was
McGovern who scooped it, and lined it home in
hope of nipping the runner.</p>

<p>A blighted hope it was, for the flying man slid
safely, and Bangs, recognizing the uselessness of
trying to tag him, winged the sphere to first,
where it arrived a moment too late to get Stark.</p>

<p>Far better than words, imagination may picture
the uproar of that hysterical moment.</p>

<p>Gradually the cheering ceased, and the
hoarse and happy Kingsbridgers became semirational.
To Stark, in a way, as much credit was
due for that finely worked squeeze as to Locke;
but it seemed that the name of the latter was on
every lip. He had made the play possible by his
hit and steal, and the delighted crowd howled
blessings at him long after he was seated on the
bench.</p>

<p>Locke’s manager looked him over unemotionally,
and then sent Crandall out to the pan, with
instructions. Hutchinson did not believe in spoiling
a youngster with praise. Furthermore, the
game was far from over, and experience had
taught him that the time to count chickens was
after the hatching.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>One man, at least, was wholly happy; Henry
Cope was confident that, after this, his fellow
members of the Kingsbridge Baseball Association,
who had given him carte blanche to secure
a star pitcher, at any price, could not make much
protest when they learned that he had contracted
to pay Tom Locke one hundred dollars a week
and board, a sum far greater than many a minor-league
pitcher of promise received.</p>

<p>Janet Harting was delighted beyond words; so
delighted, indeed, that her ebullient expressions of
joy and unreserved admiration for Locke brought
a slight frown to the dark face of Benton King.</p>

<p>There were those, however, who felt no touch
of rejoicing.</p>

<p>The Bancroft crowd was silent. Mike Riley
sat on the bench, and chewed at his dead cigar,
turning only to snarl at Fancy Dyke when the
latter called to him anxiously from behind the
rail. He had already sneered at his players because
of their inability to hit Locke, but there
was something of a still more caustic nature awaiting
them when they should again assemble at the
bench.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br>
<small>THE LAST STRIKE-OUT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">But no man on that field felt the sting of the
moment as deeply as Jock Hoover, in
whose heart hatred for Tom Locke burned
like living fire. The wonder and terror of the
league, he feared that a blazing sun had risen to
eclipse him. The effect upon him was fully apparent
when he carelessly let Stark steal second
behind his back, which brought upon him the
amused scoffing of the Kingsbridgers. Nor did it
serve to lessen the bitterness of his soul when, although
he still burned the ball over with the sharp
slants which an expert “spit artist” commands,
Crandall leaned against it for a grasser to right,
and Stark, spurred by the shrieking coacher,
crossed third, and reached the home plate, adding
another tally.</p>

<p>After that, Anastace popped, and Hinkey agitated
the air; but the damage was done.</p>

<p>Riley’s scathing, acrid arraignment of his batters
did no good. Although an error let Mace get
to first in the seventh, Locke disposed of the next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
three stickers with ease, and apparently without
any great exertion.</p>

<p>Hoover returned to the slab in form, and closed
the inning with three straight to his credit.</p>

<p>For Bancroft, hope revived when Bangs started
the eighth by obtaining a pass, the first to be
secured from Locke since the initial inning.
Hoover strode out, thirsting for a hit. Had the
stab of his eyes been deadly, Tom Locke must
have dropped, mortally pierced, in his tracks.</p>

<p>With the head of the list coming up, Riley had
called for a sacrifice, and, much as he hated to do
it, Hoover sought to obey. He did not even foul
the first ball he tried to bunt; but Oulds, in his
haste to get Bangs going down, made a bad throw,
and the runner reached second base.</p>

<p>“Ah!” thought Jock exultantly. “Now I can
hit it out!”</p>

<p>But he could not hit it out, although he did his
best. Locke sent him to the bench, fanned and
furious.</p>

<p>Harney, however, batted a lingerer into the
diamond, and little Labelle eagerly overran it,
which put two on the sacks.</p>

<p>It was still a game, and the Bancroft crowd was
beginning to froth, while the Kingsbridgers felt
their nerves shaking again. With two on, only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
one out, and Trollop and Grady to hit, all sorts of
things might happen.</p>

<p>What really happened was two strike-outs,
which went to the credit of the Kingsbridge southpaw,
and made Janet Harting declare she “just
wanted to hug him.”</p>

<p>Locke was one of Hoover’s victims in the eighth,
which, however, did not seem to disturb his equanimity
in the least, and gave the Bancrofter but
poor and unsatisfactory solace. There was no
run-getting, and the ninth opened with the Kingsbridgers
rooting for Locke to choke it off in a
hurry.</p>

<p>The “Bullies” always fought to the finish, and
they were in the game to take advantage of anything
favorable that might happen. Once more
Labelle, who should have easily handled Mace’s
grounder for an assist, became too eager, and
failed to get the ball up cleanly, following with a
poor throw that presented the runner with “a
life.”</p>

<p>Standing, every man Jack of them, the Bancrofters
on the bleachers whooped things up desperately.
They were disheartened a bit when
McGovern hoisted an infield fly, and went to the
bench; but they awoke with redoubled energy as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
Bernsteine bingled a bone-breaker against Fred
Lace’s shins, and the third baseman chased it
long enough to make fruitless any attempt to get
the man.</p>

<p>“Come, Lefty,” shouted a Kingsbridger;
“you’ll have ter do it alone. You ain’t gittin’
no s’port.”</p>

<p>And now, as if he, too, felt the strain of it, and
the tension was too much, Tom Locke handed up
four balls, and filled the sacks.</p>

<p>“It’s the same old story!” shouted Harney from
the coaching line. “They’ve gone to pieces again!
We’ve got ’em! We’ve got ’em! We win it
right here! Old southpaw is making an altitude
record! He’s gone! He’s up out of sight now!
He’ll never come down! Kill it, Bingo, if he puts
one across!”</p>

<p>Kingsbridge was apprehensively silent, taut,
and choked with dread; Bancroft howled and
screamed like a lot of caged Camorrists. Bangs
gripped his club, longing for a two-bagger, or
even a long, clean single. Locke took his time,
absolutely declining to betray signs of agitation
similar to those which had marked his advent upon
that field.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to do it, Lefty!” came entreatingly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
from the man who had shouted before. “If
you fail us now, there’ll be a fun’rul after the
game.”</p>

<p>Locke whipped over a high one.</p>

<p>“Strike!” blared the umpire.</p>

<p>Before Bangs had finished kicking at the decision,
the pitcher bent over another.</p>

<p>“Strike tuh!”</p>

<p>“Get against it, Bingo—get against it!” yelled
Harney. “Spoil the good ones, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Two balls followed. Then came a marvelous
drop that Bangs missed by many inches, and
Kingsbridge roared, drowning the Bancroft
groan.</p>

<p>Jock Hoover had been swinging two bats. He
dropped one of them, and walked into the box,
stooping a moment to rub his palms on the dry
dirt. Never in his life had he desired half as
much to get a hit, and never had he believed more
firmly that he would get one.</p>

<p>“You’re the boy, Jock!” shrieked a rooter.
“Bring ’em home! Win your own game, old
fightin’ cock!”</p>

<p>From the opposite side came a different cry:</p>

<p>“He’s your meat, Lefty! Get him, and it’s all
over! Don’t lose him, on your life!”</p>

<p>It was to be the great test. A clean hit would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
leave Hoover still supreme in the league; a strike-out
would place another far above him. The lips
of the Bully at bat curled back from his teeth,
and he stood there ready, like a man made of steel
springs. With a sort of placid grimness, Locke
swung into his delivery.</p>

<p>Hoover fouled the first one into the bleachers.</p>

<p>“Strike!”</p>

<p>“That’s one on him!”</p>

<p>“You’ve got him coming, Lefty!”</p>

<p>“He can’t hit you!”</p>

<p>“You can’t let him hit!”</p>

<p>“Do it again!”</p>

<p>Hoover stamped his spikes into the ground,
rooting himself, that the hit might be effective
when he landed on the ball. He had felt of the
first one; he would straighten the next one out.
In fancy, he saw himself cantering over the sacks,
with the runners ahead of him scoring, and the
Bancrofters splitting their throats. Doubtless
a two-bagger would score all three of the runners;
and then, even if he did not reach the rubber himself,
he would go out there and hold the “Kinks”
runless in the last of the ninth. He knew he could
do it.</p>

<p>“Ball-l-l!”</p>

<p>Jock sneered at Locke’s teaser. What a chump<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
the fellow was to think he would reach for anything
like that!</p>

<p>“Put one over!” he invited. “You don’t
dare!”</p>

<p>It came—whistling, high, and taking an inward
shoot. Hoover did not graze the horsehide.</p>

<p>“Strike tuh!”</p>

<p>That set the Kingsbridgers off again:</p>

<p>“Get him, Lefty—get him!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you, Lefty!”</p>

<p>“You’re the stuff, old boy!”</p>

<p>“Sic him, you wiz!”</p>

<p>“Mow him down!”</p>

<p>“Polish him off!”</p>

<p>“End his suffering, Lefty!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you, Lefty! Oh, you, Lefty!”</p>

<p>Hoover’s teeth were grinding together like
millstones. Although angered by his failure, he
still gripped and held his confidence that he could
hit Locke at this time when a hit meant so much;
for, as a pinch hitter, he had an enviable record.</p>

<p>Another shoot came over. Jock hit it. But
again the ball went into the bleachers, causing the
umpire to stop the base runners with a bellow:</p>

<p>“Foul!”</p>

<p>“That’s the best he can do, Lefty! He’s going!
He’s almost gone!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p>There was a delay. Some one had pocketed
the ball, and presently a spotless, fresh one was
tossed out to Locke.</p>

<p>“Where’ll that one go when he hits it?” yelled
a Bancrofter.</p>

<p>“When he hits it!” mocked a Kingsbridger.
“He never will!”</p>

<p>Leaning forward to get Oulds’ signal, Locke
gave his head a shake. The sign for a drop was
instantly changed to one calling for an inshoot,
and the young pitcher lost no time.</p>

<p>There was a white streak in the air, and the ball
almost seemed to twist round Hoover’s neck,
slightly grazing the bat close to his knuckles as he
swung. Into Oulds’ big mitt it plunked.</p>

<p>“Y’re out!” was the cry of the umpire, as he
flung his hand upward above his head.</p>

<p>Instantly Hoover called Tom Locke a vile name,
and sent the bat, with all the strength of his
quivering, muscular arms, spinning straight at
the pitcher’s head.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br>
<small>AFTER THE GAME</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The indescribable uproar which greeted the
strike-out that settled the game prevented
Hoover’s words from reaching
Locke’s ears, but the glare in his eyes, the expression
of his face, and the movement of his lips
told well enough what he said. The triumphant
pitcher barely avoided the whistling bat by an
agile side spring. In another instant, his face
went white; he was coming at Hoover with a
rush.</p>

<p>Tense with excitement, Janet Harting saw it
all; she saw the steady, youthful, almost boyish,
Kingsbridge pitcher fool the Caliban-faced Bully
for the final fruitless slash which settled the game,
two to nothing, in the home team’s favor; saw
Hoover, snarling, hurl the bat; and then beheld a
swirling rush of shouting, wrathy human beings,
who smashed the restraining rails in front of the
bleachers, and poured upon the field like a spring
flood from a bursted reservoir.</p>

<p>“I think,” said Benton King, gathering the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
reins, “that it is time for me to take you away
from here, Janet.”</p>

<p>Trembling, she grasped his arm. “No, no!”
she cried. “What are they going to do? That
wretch threw his bat at—at Lefty.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and he’ll get his, if his friends don’t look
out for him well. Locke has got all Kingsbridge
behind him, and they’re a tough bunch when they
get good and mad. There’s likely to be some
broken heads.”</p>

<p>“Oh, wait a moment!” she entreated. “Look!
They’re trying to hold the crowd off, and I believe
Lefty is helping them.”</p>

<p>Out there on the diamond, raging, frothing men
were shaking their fists at the offending pitcher;
while others, including a number of Kingsbridge
players, having packed themselves round the
threatened man, were holding the hot-heads back
by main force. And it was true that Tom Locke
was one of those who sought to protect Jock
Hoover from the wolfish mob.</p>

<p>“Stop!” his voice rang out, clear and distinct.
“Keep back! The trouble is between that man
and me. We’ll settle it.”</p>

<p>“Let-a me git at-a him!” raged an Italian, the
same who had amused the crowd after the striking
out of Mace in the first inning, by asking what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
was the matter with Lefty. “He throw-a da bat!
I knock-a da block off-a da sneak-a!”</p>

<p>His cigar gone, his hat smashed, his collar torn
awry, Mike Riley succeeded in reaching Hoover.</p>

<p>“You infernal idiot!” he puffed. “Didn’t you
know better? What made ye do it?”</p>

<p>“Bah!” retorted Jock with contempt and courage
worthy of a better cause. “These barking
curs won’t do anything. Give me a show, and I’ll
break that left-handed dub’s face. He hasn’t got
the courage to give me an opportunity right now—here.
He’s a——” The concluding epithet
was a repetition of the insult he had hurled at
Locke along with the bat.</p>

<p>“No man can swallow that!” muttered Larry
Stark. “Somebody must fight that miserable
rowdy.”</p>

<p>“Give me the chance,” said Tom Locke, “and
give him the same even show, without interference.
Let the crowd keep back.” They marveled
at his calmness.</p>

<p>Some of Hoover’s friends sought to rush him
off, against his will, and the vociferous, twisting,
lunging mass of humanity swept over to one side
of the diamond, where Bent King had his hands
full in the task of restraining his fretting span
from plunging forward and trampling some of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
them. King had listened to Janet’s appeal, and
dallied a few moments too long; now they were
caught in the midst of the mob that packed close
on all sides. Two men, taking note of his difficulty,
grasped the horses by the bits; but the
crowd, seemingly deaf and oblivious to everything
except the imminent fist fight, could not be
induced to make way.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Janet,” said the lumberman’s son.
“This is no place for you. I was a fool to wait
a minute when the trouble began.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” she returned, her voice quivering
a little, her face quite colorless. “I—I want
to see. It isn’t right for them to fight; it isn’t
fair. Lefty can’t be a match for that ruffian.
Why don’t they stop it?”</p>

<p>Not much time was wasted in preparation when
it was understood that Locke was ready to meet
his challenger. Members of the two teams began
pushing the crowd back to make room, begging
them to give the men a chance, and a fifteen-foot
space was finally cleared. Eager spectators
climbed upon the shoulders of those in front of
them; the bleachers, at one end, were loaded to
the cracking point with human beings; and every
stout limb of a near-by tree quickly bore human
fruit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>Bareheaded, the men met in the center of the
cleared space. Hoover came with a rush, and
Locke was not dilatory. Plainly the Bully
weighed ten or fifteen pounds more than his
slender antagonist, and many a sympathizer with
the youth feared the match must prove to be pitifully
one-sided.</p>

<p>Jock led, right and left; but the youngster
parried, blocked, and countered like lightning,
closing in without hesitation. His jaw was set,
and he was still cool, while the Bancrofter blazed
with all the fury of a conflagration.</p>

<p>The sound of thudding blows caused Janet
Harting to drop her parasol, which she had closed;
her hands went up to her heart, and her lips were
parted that she might breathe, the open air seeming
close and smothery.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br>
<small>MAN TO MAN</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">It was a scene to be printed indelibly on the
memory: The palpitant, swaying crowd,
those in front pushed forward by those behind;
the baseball players round the edges of the
cleared space, bracing to hold the mob back almost
by main strength; human beings climbing on
other human beings to get a momentary glimpse
of the fighters; men and boys jammed in a dense
mass on the bleachers, and still more of them
clinging like monkeys to the bending limbs of the
tree—and every face ablaze with the primitive
passion of mankind, the savage zest of battle, the
barbarous joy of witnessing a sanguinary struggle
between two of their specie.</p>

<p>But Janet saw only the fighters; not for a
moment did her straining eyes waver or wander.
She watched them leap and retreat, meet again,
stagger, recover, sway this way and that, all the
time turning round and round to the left or to
the right, their arms flashing out, their battering
fists giving forth sounds now sharp, now sodden,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
as they smashed on head or body. She saw the
head of the brown-haired youth jerk backward
before a blow full on the mouth; and then, as blood
stained his lips, a cry—half snarl, half roar—broke
from the crowd.</p>

<p>Hoover had drawn first blood, seeing which, an
expression of malicious joy contorted his repellent
face, and he seemed spurred to still fiercer efforts.
He thirsted to leave the stamp of his fists indelibly
recorded on that clean-cut face; to mark the
youth for life would be an exquisite pleasure,
lingering long in aftertaste.</p>

<p>Locke, however, continued to keep his head, improving
such openings as he could find or make.
A cut lip was of no consequence when he had not
felt the blow much; but he must take care that
his antagonist did not reach his jaw with a swing
like that, having a bit more steam behind it. And
he must husband his energy and bide his time,
for this was no fight by rounds, and Hoover had
set a pace which flesh and blood could not keep up
protractedly. In time, he must weary and
slacken, and Locke hoped to be ready to make
the most of it when this faltering came.</p>

<p>The youth’s left-handed guard bothered Jock
somewhat, causing him to fret and snarl. Twice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
he pinned Locke up against the crowd, that could
not make room for his free movement; but once
Tom got under his arm and away, and once he met
the aggressor with such a sudden storm of blows
that Hoover was checked and driven back. After
that both men were bleeding, the Bully having
received a stiff smash on the nose.</p>

<p>The crowd shouted applause and instruction:</p>

<p>“Fine work, Lefty!”</p>

<p>“Keep after him, Jock! Put him out!”</p>

<p>“You’ve got him going! Follow him up!”</p>

<p>“Look out for his left, boy!”</p>

<p>“Soak him another in the same place—that’s
the stuff!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Bent King, in wonderment, “I’ll
be hanged if Locke isn’t holding his own with that
terrier!”</p>

<p>Apparently Janet did not hear him. A little
color had risen into her cheeks, and her bosom
was heaving against her tightly clenched hands.
She was still fearful of the final result, but he
with whom her throbbing heart sympathized had
met his brutal enemy like a man of courage, and
made it a worthy battle. She could hear Hoover
breathing heavily, like one on whom the tremendous
strain was beginning to tell at last, while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
Locke, although his breast rose and fell rapidly,
was, to all outward seeming, the fresher of the
two.</p>

<p>Once a little, choking gasp escaped her, for
the youth was sent reeling by a blow, Jock rushing
forward to follow it up. Locke, however, kept
his feet with the agility of a cat, avoiding that
rush, and getting in a body punch that made the
other man grunt.</p>

<p>Following this, discovering at last the drain his
efforts were putting upon him, Hoover sought to
take it easier, and recuperate. This quickly became
apparent, and a cry arose:</p>

<p>“He’s stalling, Lefty! Go to him! Don’t let
him get his wind back!”</p>

<p>Locke had no intention of permitting his antagonist
to rest, and now he took the aggressive,
and kept at it with persistence that wore on
Hoover.</p>

<p>Up to this point, Mike Riley had entertained no
doubt as to what the end must be, but now uncertainty
seized him, followed by alarm as he beheld
tokens which seemed to denote that Hoover was
becoming a bit groggy.</p>

<p>The Bancroft manager had no wish to see his
puissant slabman whipped, for that would leave
him no longer the terror he had been to opposing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
batsmen; and much of his success as a pitcher had
doubtless come through the awe which he had inspired.</p>

<p>“Hey!” croaked Riley suddenly. “I guess
this here’s gone ’bout fur enough.”</p>

<p>But, with his first movement to interfere, he
was seized by more than one pair of hands, jerked
back, and held.</p>

<p>“Guess again!” cried Larry Stark. “Hoover
forced it on the boy, and now he’ll have to take his
medicine.”</p>

<p>“That’s right! That’s right!” shouted half a
hundred voices.</p>

<p>“You bet it’s right!” roared a big millman in
the crowd. “If this Bancroft bunch tries to
meddle now in a square fight, they’ll have the
whole o’ Kingsbridge on top of ’em.”</p>

<p>Possibly a free-for-all fight might have broken
out at this point, but suddenly Tom Locke’s fist
fell on Hoover’s jaw with a crack like a pistol
report, and the Bancroft pitcher’s legs seemed to
melt beneath him.</p>

<p>Prone upon the trampled ground he sank in a
huddled heap, while Locke, lowering his hands at
his sides, stepped back and stood looking down at
him. A hush came over the crowd. The fallen
man made a blind, feeble effort to lift himself,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
turned his body partly, then slumped back, his
face in the turf, and lay still.</p>

<p>“He’s put Jock out!” said some one in an
awed and marveling voice.</p>

<p>With a yell, Larry Stark leaped forward and
seized the victor’s hand. That yell was echoed
by the mob.</p>

<p>“Lefty did it!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you, Lefty! Oh, you, Lefty!”</p>

<p>Locke’s face was sober and unsmiling, betraying
no elation. Satisfied that it was really over, he
lifted his eyes, and found himself unexpectedly
gazing into the wide blue eyes of a girl who was
looking down at him from a carriage round which
the crowd was wedged. For a moment they stared
at each other, while the cheering continued, and
slowly a flush of shame mounted into Tom Locke’s
cheeks. He turned away.</p>

<p>“Come, Bent,” said Janet in a husky voice,
“can’t we get out of here now? I’m really faint.
Please hurry.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br>
<small>BENTON KING AWAKENS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Janet was pale and silent as King drove
into town. Glancing at her, he saw that
her lips were pressed together, her smooth
brow puckered a bit, and her eyes filled with a
strange, thoughtful expression. Her hands
tightly gripped the handle of her parasol.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry it happened that way, Janet,” he
said apologetically. “It was thoughtless of me to
get caught in that mob, so that you were compelled
to suffer the humiliation of witnessing such
a brutal spectacle.”</p>

<p>“You were not to blame,” she returned, in a
low, queer voice. “I begged you to wait. I’m
glad I did.”</p>

<p>“You’re what—glad?” he exclaimed, astonished.
“It was not a thing for a girl like you
to see and hear.”</p>

<p>“Still,” she declared, “I am glad I saw it. I
know now that any man with an atom of manhood
in his make-up may sometimes be compelled to
fight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<p>“That’s right,” he agreed, “and he can’t
always pick a gentleman, or a man of his own
class, for an antagonist.”</p>

<p>She looked at him quickly. “Do you think
Tom Locke is a gentleman?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know about that; it’s doubtful,
considering the company he’s with.”</p>

<p>“Do gentlemen never play baseball?”</p>

<p>“Certainly—in college games.”</p>

<p>“But they <em>never</em> play professionally?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t say that, you know,” was his slow
answer. “Some college men go in for professional
baseball after graduating. Almost always,
they need the money to give them a start in some
chosen profession or business. But not all college
players are gentlemen, by any means; far
from it. At Harvard, even though baseball and
football players and members of the track team
were decidedly popular in a general way, there
were none of them in my set, and I didn’t see fit
to associate with them much.”</p>

<p>Even as he said it, he flushed a bit, knowing
she, like many others in Kingsbridge, must be
fully aware of the fact that his exasperated father
had removed him from Harvard in his sophomore
year to avoid the disgrace of his suspension, or
possible expulsion, because of certain wild escapades<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
in which he had been concerned, along with
some others of his own particularly swift set.
Nevertheless, he had his standards of deportment
and qualifications essential to the gentleman,
though, doubtless, it would be no easy matter to
make them clear to some strait-laced, narrow-minded
persons.</p>

<p>He was nettled by the conviction that Janet
was suddenly taking altogether too much interest
in the practically unknown Kingsbridge
pitcher, who, following his surprising double victory
of the day, was surely destined to become
a popular idol in the town. He had known Janet
three years, having met her at a church sociable
in the days when Cyrus King was setting about in
earnest, by the construction of his mills, to turn
Kingsbridge from a dull, sleepy settlement into
a hustling, chesty town. At first she had seemed
to be an unusually pretty, vivacious little girl, with
somewhat more refinement and good sense than
the usual run of country maidens; but that he
would ever become genuinely and deeply interested
in her had not occurred to him as a remote
possibility. Even after he had left college and
begun work in the big sawmill, although he found
her much matured and developed, and therefore
still more interesting, he but slowly came to realize<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
that she was the possessor of some potent charm,
indefinite, elusive, indescribable, which was casting
a powerful spell over him.</p>

<p>Not until this day, however, had he realized
how firmly this spell had gripped him. It had
come upon him as a surprise which he obstinately
tried to misinterpret; for why should he, the only
son and heir of old Cy King, several times over a
millionaire, permit himself to be bewitched past
self-mastery by this little country girl, daughter
of a broken-down village parson, who had not tried
to bewitch him at all? It seemed ridiculous, something
to demand self-reproach; for, least of all,
when he thought of such a thing, which was rarely,
had he fancied himself silly enough to be caught
in such a net. Moreover, he knew what stormy
anger the knowledge would produce in his father
if the knowledge ever came to him.</p>

<p>The truth had stabbed him there upon the baseball
field. It had taken the piercing form of a
jealous pang, which he had sought to conceal when
he saw that Janet was becoming interested in
the new Kingsbridge pitcher; and it cut deeper
and deeper as her interest grew and developed
into out-spoken admiration. He had seen her
watching that fierce fist fight, knowing all the
while that she was praying that Locke might conquer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
and, though she had held herself marvelously
in hand, he seemed to fathom all the torture
and dread which filled her heart. That she should
care so much what might happen to a total
stranger, even though he were the new-found
idol of the Kingsbridge fans, was sufficient to
skim the scales swiftly from Benton King’s eyes,
and leave him confessing to himself, without
shame, that she was very dear to him. For, trite
but true, that which we desire very much becomes
a thousand times more desirable as our chance
of possession grows less.</p>

<p>And now, as they drove slowly homeward, something
writhed and burned within him at the
further evidence of her interest in Locke. He
was tempted to speak up boldly and say that
there was not one chance in a million that the
fellow could be a gentleman; but he had not yet
lost his head, even if his heart was gone, and he
had sense enough to know that such a course
might be the most unwise one he could pursue.
So he held himself in check, registering an inward
vow that he would see to it that this fellow
Locke found as little chance as might be to give
him worriment over Janet.</p>

<p>Too soon the little parsonage, a modest story-and-a-half
house, one of the oldest in Kingsbridge,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
came into view. Too soon they were at the door,
and he was helping her to alight. He held her
hand to the extreme limit of good taste, held it
and pressed it, saying:</p>

<p>“I shall be at church to-morrow. If you don’t
mind, it would give me pleasure to escort you home
after the services.”</p>

<p>She looked at him in surprise, her lips parted
in an odd little smile, her violet eyes emphasizing
her wonderment.</p>

<p>“Why, Bent, you’ve scarcely attended church
half a dozen times since you came home from college.
What brings you out to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“You!” he answered, feeling himself thrill and
choke a bit. “I’m a heathen, I admit; but I’m
coming out to-morrow to worship—you.” He had
said such things before, to other girls, but he had
spoken them lightly, and without a tremor; now
little electric vibrations were running along his
nerves, and, though he knew that his face was
pale, he could feel his swollen heart pulsing hard,
and his temples drumming. He had never
dreamed that saying such a “little thing” to a
pretty girl would come so near unmanning him.</p>

<p>Her surprise had grown, but she was self-possessed.
“Thou shalt not worship false gods,” she
laughed. Then, as if she saw something in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
eyes which made her fear he would go further, she
hastily gave her consent: “If you come out to
church to-morrow I’ll permit you to walk home
with me—after Sabbath School. That’ll be your
reward for listening to father’s sermon. Now,
for the first time in my life, I feel that I have
really done something for the heathen.”</p>

<p>Laughing, she ran up the steps of the trellised
porch, turning a moment to say good night,
framed in an arch of June green vines. Head
bared, he gazed at that picture, and found it the
fairest his eyes had ever looked upon. There
was now in his mind no question, no doubt; he
knew.</p>

<p>“Good night, Janet,” he said softly. “Until
to-morrow, and that will be—a year.” He had
laughed at silly, lovesick chaps who said things
like that; but now, before he knew what he was
saying, he had uttered it with all the sincerity of
his soul.</p>

<small>FATHER AND DAUGHTER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The door of the Reverend John Harting’s
study was open. In the softened afternoon
light which came from the window
above his desk, he sat, giving his morrow’s sermon
the last polishing touches. But when Janet would
have slipped past, he heard her light footstep, and
called to her. She stopped at the door.</p>

<p>“Come in, my dear,” he said, lifting his spectacles
to his forehead, and turning from the outspread
pages of manuscript. “Would you mind
sitting down a moment? I have something I
wish to say to you.”</p>

<p>He spoke precisely and formally, and even in
ordinary conversation he had a touch of that
singsong intonation which all old-time ministers
affected. A fringe of white locks, carefully
combed, added to the somewhat stern, but almost
patriarchal, expression of his angular, deeply
lined face. It was the fearless face of a good-hearted
man, and yet there was something about
it indicative of narrowness and bigotry. Such a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
face, one fancied, might have belonged to a leader
of martyrs.</p>

<p>She came to him, and sat upon the arm of his
chair, encircling his neck, and patting his cheek.</p>

<p>“Now, father, dear,” she laughed coaxingly,
“I hope you’re not going to scold. I know you
didn’t want me to go to the ball game, but I
was just dying to go, and Benton invited me,
and—”</p>

<p>“He came round here, and cajoled me into consenting,
against my will. He is a young man
with a most persuasive and flattering tongue.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not dispute you,” she said, thinking of
those parting words at the door. “He needed a
persuasive tongue to win you over, you are
so dreadfully set against baseball. You can’t
seem to realize that the game itself is really harmless
and clean, and two-thirds of the people of
this town are crazy over it. They’ll be crazier
still after to-day, for we beat Bancroft—shut ’em
out without a single tally, gave ’em nine beautiful
goose eggs. What do you think of that, father?”</p>

<p>He looked a bit puzzled. “What have goose
eggs to do with baseball, my dear?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” she laughed, “I mean to say that we
handed them a beautiful coat of whitewash, and
we bingled out a couple of merit marks for ourselves.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
The crowd just went crazy when our new
southpaw slant artist started the fireworks going
in the sixth with a clean wallop, moved up a peg
on a sacrifice, pilfered the third hassock, and slid
home on a beautiful squeeze that gave us our
first count, and—”</p>

<p>“Stop, Janet!” he cried, bewildered. “What
are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“Why, baseball, daddy! I’m simply telling
you how we won the game.”</p>

<p>“You may be trying to tell me, but you are not
doing it simply. ‘Coat of whitewash,’ ‘bingle,’
‘southpaw slant artist,’ ‘clean wallop,’ ‘third hassock,’
‘beautiful squeeze’! My dear, it’s dreadful
for a young lady to use such language. It is ample
evidence of the absolutely demoralizing influence
of this game called baseball.”</p>

<p>She laughed still more gayly, and again patted
his cheek caressingly. “That’s simply the idiom
of the game, which every true fan understands.”</p>

<p>“But you should remember that I am not a true
fan, whatever that may mean. I abhor slang,
especially from the lips of a refined girl. You
know my efforts alone last year prevented the
desecration of the Sabbath by this dreadful game,
which seems to turn people’s heads, and is productive
of untold strife and bitterness. What<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
will be thought now when my daughter is seen attending
these games?”</p>

<p>“But they are not playing Sunday baseball,
daddy, and I agree that you were quite right in
bringing your influence to bear against that,
though, as I said before, I hold that there is no
harm in the game itself.”</p>

<p>“There is harm in whatever produces harm,
which is sufficient answer to your argument. And
look at the class of men who take part in those
games. Would you be proud to associate with
them? Would you choose them as friends?”</p>

<p>“No,” she confessed; “not many of them; but
still there are some really decent ones who play.
Larry Stark is one. I know him, and I’m not
ashamed of it.”</p>

<p>“There may be an occasional exception, but you
know the old saying that exceptions prove the
rule. Once in a while a respectable young man
may be led by necessity to make a business of
baseball, but I am sure no such young man will
long continue to follow it up.”</p>

<p>“Respectable people watch the games. Some
of the best people in Kingsbridge were there to-day.”</p>

<p>“Which denotes a deplorable tendency of the
times. And you must not forget that this town<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
has changed from a peaceful country settlement
to a place that is rough and crude, and filled with
viciousness and vice. I am having a struggle
against these evil influences, and I need the moral
support of my daughter’s example, at least. If
your mother had lived—”</p>

<p>“Now, father, please don’t! You seem to have
an idea that I’m a most reckless, wicked young
person, and you always use that form of argument
to shame me in my sinful ways. I saw in
the grand stand to-day several of the most respectable
ladies in town, at least two of whom are
regular attendants at your church.”</p>

<p>“Some seed must fall on barren ground. I
hope young King will not ask you to go with
him again. If he comes to me, I shall refuse
my consent; if you go, you will do so against my
wishes.”</p>

<p>With him in this inflexible mood, she knew the
uselessness of persuasion or cajolery, and she left
him, to run up to her room a few moments before
the maid should call them to tea. Removing her
hat before the mirror, she pouted a little at the
charming reflection in the glass.</p>

<p>“Father is so set,” she murmured; “yet I’ve
always been able to bring him round some way,
and I must do it about this; for I just can’t stay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
away from the games. I guess I’m a real fan,
all right, and I’ll be worse than ever with Kingsbridge
winning from Bancroft, and—and Lefty
pitching. He’s surely what they can call <em>some
pitcher</em>. And he can fight—gracious!”</p>

<p>She shivered a bit at the recollection of the scene
she had witnessed after the game was over.
Again she seemed to behold those fighting men
hammering at each other with their bare fists,
savage, bloodstained, brutal. She shuddered at
the remembered glare of their eyes, the wheezing
of their panted breathing, and the crushing sound
of their blows. From her parted lips came a little
gasp, as once more on her ears seemed to fall the
clear crack of Tom Locke’s fist smiting his foe
full on the point of the jaw with such force that
Hoover’s legs had given way beneath him like
props of straw.</p>

<p>“He can pitch, and he can fight,” she whispered.
“He looks clean and manly, too. I wonder what
he’s really like. I suppose he must be coarse and
vulgar. When father hears about that affair,
he’ll be far more set against the game than ever,
and he’s sure to hear, for the whole town must
be talking of it now.”</p>

<p>While she made her toilet for tea, the clean-cut,
determined face of the young pitcher seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
haunt her. Vexed by this, she decided to put him
resolutely out of her mind.</p>

<p>“I’m like a silly schoolgirl, seeking a hero to
worship,” she laughed, blushing at her folly.
“I’m old enough to know better. Such heroes always
have feet of clay. Still, I’d like to think of
him as well as I can—as a pitcher; and, to do so,
it is wise that I should view him from afar, that
his flaws may not be too apparent. I’ll take care
about that.”</p>

<p>Then her thoughts turned to Benton King, and
a little frown gathered upon her face. To-day, as
they were driving homeward, and especially as
they were saying good night at the door, there
had been something in his manner and his words
that he had never before unveiled to her. Hitherto
they had been just good friends—he deferential,
in a way—yet free and easy, as such friends
might be, with no self-consciousness or constraint;
but now, after this, something warned her that it
would be changed, even though, as she believed,
he had been neither deep nor sincere in what he
had felt or said.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” she murmured, still frowning;
“for I like Bent, and he’s about the only young
man in Kingsbridge I’d care to be really friendly
with. I suppose it’s been so long since he’s had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
an opportunity to talk such nonsense to a girl that
he just had to try it on some one to keep in practice.
But I don’t like it, and I’ll have to stop it.
Next time he tries it, I’ll chaff him till he quits.
I’ll tell him I like Lefty.”</p>

<p>She could not have chosen a more certain
method of preventing Benton King from quitting.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br>
<small>THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The sermon was dry and tiresome, old-fashioned
and overflowing with “doctrine.”
John Harting had never made a pretense
of sympathizing with the liberality of modern
dominies who relied wholly for the saving of souls
upon “the message of love.” True, he had
ceased openly to preach “hell fire,” but doubtless
he still believed in it, if not as a literal punishment
for the sinful hereafter, then as the only
adequate synonym of the penalty that should be
meted out to the evil-doer who died unregenerate.</p>

<p>He had found that such preaching, instead of
attracting and holding congregations, left the
pews of the little old church sadly vacant; and
the effort to modify his sermons had taken from
them the little heart they once possessed, and
made them wearisome and soporific.</p>

<p>The day was warm and sunny, and at times
faint little grateful breezes, venturing in at the
open windows, brought the June odors of flowers,
and grass, and green growing things. Birds were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
singing in the trees which shaded the church, and
away out yonder the river smiled, and the woods
beckoned one to cool shadows and mossy glades.</p>

<p>Thoughts of those glades and shadows occupied
Janet in her pew far more than thoughts of
the sermon. But those were not by any means
her only thoughts; once or twice she had ventured
an admirably careless and unstudied glance
in the direction of two young men who were sitting
far over at the side of the church, both of whom
were maintaining a commendable and heroic mien
of strict attention to the words of the parson.</p>

<p>It was not, however, Larry Stark who had
drawn her glances; her eyes had been directed toward
the clear profile of Larry’s pewmate, concerning
whom she was again wondering and conjecturing.
On discovering Tom Locke there, she
had felt a shock of surprise, yet somehow he did
not seem at all out of place, and never was there
the faintest token that the experience was for him
in any degree novel or unusual.</p>

<p>So absorbed was she in her speculations that
presently she was almost startled to find the sermon
ended, and to hear her father intoning the first
lines of the closing hymn; never before had one of
his discourses seemed so short and passed so
quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>Standing, she sang with the congregation, without
recourse to the hymn book. She had a voice
that was clear, and sweet, and true, expressive
and sympathetic; she was doubly charming when
she sang.</p>

<p>In the midst of that hymn she suddenly became
self-conscious, and felt the warm color mounting
into her cheeks; although she did not see it, intuition
or something of the sort told her that <em>he</em> had
turned to look in her direction.</p>

<p>Following the benediction, she lingered to speak
with some near-by friends. Passing down the
aisle to the door, she found herself face to face
with Stark and Locke, coming across at the rear
from the far side. Larry bowed, and she gave
him a friendly smile in return.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to see you at our church again this
year, Mr. Stark,” she said.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Miss Harting,” he returned.
“I’m afraid I didn’t come as often as I should last
year. Let me introduce my friend, Mr. Locke,
one of our players.”</p>

<p>Their eyes met again, but how changed were the
circumstances! Still, it was not she alone who remembered,
and the flush on his face was no feeble
reflection of that upon her own. She murmured
something, her lids drooping quickly; in her ears<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
his voice—strong, fine of timbre, well modulated—sounded
pleasantly. She was disturbed by the
remarkable behavior of her heart.</p>

<p>Afterward she could not recall what she had
said, but she remembered his words accurately.
They were few and formal, but they were uttered
in that unmistakable way which marks the speech
of a man of breeding.</p>

<p>She took particular note of his hands; while
they were a bit slender, with long fingers, there
was something about them indicative of physical
strength, and strength of character, as well. She
wondered that a baseball player could have such
fine, well-groomed hands; and she had come to
believe that the hand of any man tattles the secrets
of him to whom it belongs.</p>

<p>After a few moments, the ball players passed
out of the church between two lines of children
waiting to enter for Sabbath school when the congregation
should have departed. Even as she
smilingly greeted some of those children, Janet’s
eyes followed the retreating figure of Tom Locke.</p>

<p>She was a bit startled to hear some one speak to
her, and to discover Bent King, hat in hand, at
her side. His face was unusually pale, and there
was in his eyes something resembling anger. His
voice sounded unnatural and harsh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>“I must say those two—er—fellows had their
nerve with them!” he observed, in a low tone.
“It took a crust for them to stop and speak to you
here. I—I felt like punching their heads!”</p>

<p>“I am very glad you did not permit your feelings
to master you,” she said, with a faint laugh.
“I met Larry Stark last year, and I was glad to
see him at church to-day. He introduced Mr.
Locke, the new pitcher.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I saw it all,” Bent half growled. “I was
standing out here in the vestibule, where I could
look inside, and I saw them time their movements
to meet you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! You must be mistaken.”</p>

<p>“I’m not—begging your pardon, Janet. I say
it was a sheer case of nerve for two hired ball
players to do a thing like that. I saw people staring
as you were talking to them. I don’t wonder
you were embarrassed.”</p>

<p>“Embarrassed! You must be mistaken, Benton.”</p>

<p>“Of course you were embarrassed—you blushed
like fire. It was humiliating to be compelled to
acknowledge an introduction to a common scrapper
like that man Locke.”</p>

<p>“I assure you that I did not feel at all humiliated,”
she returned, with a touch of defiance.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
“Instead, I was glad of the opportunity to meet
him.”</p>

<p>King choked; the pallor of anger gave way to a
flush of the same nature, and he gazed at her resentfully.</p>

<p>“You must be jesting,” he said, endeavoring
to restrain himself. “I hope you’re not baiting
me.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. Ever since the game yesterday I
have felt much curiosity concerning Tom Locke.
To some extent, it has been satisfied. I admit I
was surprised to find him plainly very much of a
gentleman.”</p>

<p>He bit his lip, his gloved hands gripping and
crushing the soft felt hat, and for the moment he
was afraid to speak again. Hatred for Tom
Locke throbbed in every pulse beat.</p>

<p>She broke the momentary silence: “What are
you doing here—now?”</p>

<p>“I am waiting to walk home with you.”</p>

<p>“But it is too early. I told you after Sabbath
school.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wait,” he said.</p>

<p>“Don’t let me put you to that trouble.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wait,” he repeated grimly.</p>

<p>He was waiting at the door when she came forth
after Sabbath school was over, and he fell in at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
her side. She made an observation about the beautiful
day, but his face wore a shadow, and it was of
something quite different that he presently spoke.</p>

<p>“I hope, Janet,” he said, “that you are not becoming
interested in that man Locke?”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I <em>am</em> interested in him,” she returned,
laughing. “How can I help being? He is a wonderful
pitcher, and he has shown that he can take
care of himself when crowded into a corner.
Every one who has seen him must be interested
in him.”</p>

<p>“You know what I mean, Janet. He is a professional
ball player, a stranger, a man whom no
one around here knows anything about.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Cope must know a great deal about
him, or he’d never signed him for the team. I’d
really like to ask Mr. Cope some questions.”</p>

<p>“Don’t! If you do that, if you’re not careful,
you’ll have people gossiping. You know how easy
it is to start gossip in a small country town.”</p>

<p>She tossed her head a bit. “Yes, I know; but if
they want to gossip over nothing at all, I’ll not attempt
to deprive them of the pleasure.”</p>

<p>“These baseball players,” he went on, “always
think they can mash any country girl they choose.
I understand that they joke and boast of their
conquests, and laugh about the silly girls who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
get stuck on them. You should have foresight
enough—”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Mr. King!” she interrupted
frigidly. “You seem to presume that I’m
anxious to pick up a flirtation with a baseball
player. I assure you that you are mistaken; but,
even if you were not, you could not choose a better
method of making yourself offensive.”</p>

<p>He saw he had made a false step; in vain he
tried to remedy the error. She would not quarrel,
nor would she discuss the matter further,
maintaining silence, save when it became absolutely
necessary, out of politeness, to make some
answer to what he was saying. Cursing himself
for a blunderer, he apologized as well as he could,
speaking of their long friendship, and his natural
interest in her, which might have led any one into
such an indiscretion. At the door of the parsonage
they parted, he still humble and penitent, she
still cool and formal.</p>

<p>“I’m a fool!” he growled as he strode away.
“I should have known better. I <em>did</em> know better,
but I lost my head when I saw him fawning upon
her—when I saw her, poppy-cheeked, looking after
him. If he takes a fancy to cut in on my preserves,
he’ll find the going rough. I’ll guarantee
he has a vulnerable spot, and I’ll locate it.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br>
<small>THE AGITATION IN BANCROFT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">More than a hundred men, laborers and
mill hands, bearing new brooms, recently
bought in grocery stores, and
making a tremendous noise with tin horns, cow
bells, and voices, were marching down the main
street of Bancroft.</p>

<p>They were Kingsbridge fans, who had come
down to the city to root for their baseball team,
and to back it up, if necessary, should a disturbance
start upon the field; and, to the last horny-handed
husky, they looked like fellows who would
as soon fight as eat; one might have fancied, even,
that not a few of them were the sort who would
leave a meal any day to take a hand in a healthy,
head-cracking scrap.</p>

<p>At any rate, their appearance had been sufficient
to serve notice of the cause which had brought
them thirty miles by rail on this mid-week day to
sit in a bunch on the Bancroft bleachers while the
game was in progress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>After the affair in Kingsbridge, which ended
with the whipping of Hoover, there had been rumors
that the resentful Bancrofters would do
things to Locke when he appeared in the city down
the river, which had brought out this picked band
of Lefty’s admirers with the openly proclaimed
intention of being concerned in such “doings” as
might come off.</p>

<p>The game was over, the Kinks had won again,
and there had been no riot. Up to the seventh, it
had been another pretty struggle between Locke
and Hoover, but when the first Kingsbridger
opened that fatal inning with a stinging two-sacker,
the local pitcher went up in the air for the
first time in the Northern League, being bumped
for three earned runs before Manager Riley
brought himself to send in a substitute. The
game had terminated with the score seven to three
in Kingsbridge’s favor. Hence the demonstration
of the rejoicing visitors, as they marched
down through town to take the homeward-bound
train.</p>

<p>Mike Riley, chewing at his inevitable cigar,
stood on a corner, and sullenly watched the parade.
After the game, he had not lingered to
say anything to his players, for he knew that his
mood would lead him into remarks not at all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
soothing or flattering, and mere talk could not
remedy what had happened.</p>

<p>Some one grabbed Riley by the elbow, and he
looked round, to see Fancy Dyke, accompanied by
Rufus Kilgore, a lawyer, who was one of the backers
of the Bancroft team. Dyke’s thin lips were
pressed together, the corners being pulled down
into something half sneer, half snarl. The lawyer
looked disturbed.</p>

<p>“What’re you doing?” asked Fancy. “Standin’
here to give them howlin’ muckers a chance to
see how bad you feel? Where’s the police, anyhow?
They oughter pinch that whole bunch for
disturbin’ the peace.”</p>

<p>“It would take the whole police force of the city
to arrest a single man of them and land him in
the caboose,” said Kilgore. “Kingsbridge didn’t
send down a hundred fighting men to see any one
of them pinched because he was celebrating a
victory over us.”</p>

<p>“We was lookin’ for you, Riley,” said Dyke.
“Come on over to Kilgore’s office.”</p>

<p>“What for?” growled the manager, having
drawn back and shaken off Fancy’s hand.</p>

<p>“We’re goin’ to have a consultation; we’re
goin’ to talk this thing over. Jorkins and Butler
will be right along. We’ve told ’em to come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>“What’re you tryin’ to do—make trouble fer
me?” rasped Riley resentfully. “You’ve got
busy mighty quick after the game, ain’t ye?”</p>

<p>“It’s sure time something was done,” retorted
Fancy defensively. “This town won’t stand for
much more of the medicine it had to swaller to-day.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed the lawyer. “Everybody
is sore over it. To be downed by Fryeburg
or Lakeport would be bad enough, but to have
Kingsbridge rub it into us—oh, blazes!”</p>

<p>“I don’t s’pose you guys got an idea I’m goin’
to lay down and let the Kinks keep it up right
along?” snapped the manager. “I reckoned you
knew I warn’t built that way.”</p>

<p>“It won’t do any hurt to talk over what’s to be
done,” said Dyke. “Come on!”</p>

<p>Riley followed them, scowling blackly. They
crossed the street along which the hilarious Kingsbridgers
had passed, came to an open doorway two
blocks farther on, and mounted a rather dark flight
of stairs. Kilgore jingled a bunch of keys attached
to a chain, and opened a door bearing his
name lettered upon it, at the head of the stairs.</p>

<p>The office consisted of two uncarpeted rooms,
the front and larger having windows which looked
upon the street. The lawyer flung open one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
those windows, through which drifted distant and
dying sounds of the celebrating Kingsbridgers.
Then he motioned his companions to chairs, himself
taking the swivel in front of his littered, untidy
desk.</p>

<p>“Had to let my stenographer off for the game,”
he said. “She made a bluff that she was half sick
and had a terrible headache, but I knew what ailed
her, and I cured her by giving her a pass. She’ll
come back to-morrow feeling worse than ever over
our licking.”</p>

<p>“Natural enough,” said Dyke, sitting down.
“It’ll make the whole town sick.”</p>

<p>Riley’s chair cracked under his weight. “Ain’t
got a swaller of somethin’ round here, have ye,
Kilgore?” he asked.</p>

<p>The lawyer produced a “longnecker” and a
dirty glass. “Running water in the back room
if you want it,” he said.</p>

<p>But the manager, having no desire to dilute
the amber liquid with which he almost overran
the glass, and disdaining a “chaser,” took his
“straight.” Dyke followed with a small “nip,”
but Kilgore asked to be excused from joining
them, and put away the bottle and glass.</p>

<p>Heavy steps sounded on the stairs. A tall, slim,
sallow man entered, a puffing, red-faced, rolypoly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
individual toddling at his heels. These were Timothy
Jorkins and Ira Butler, both financial backers
of the team, and members of the Bancroft B.
B. A.</p>

<p>“Here you are!” said Jorkins, in a deep voice
pregnant with accusation, fixing his eyes on Riley.</p>

<p>“Yes, here you are!” gurgled Butler, likewise
glaring at the manager.</p>

<p>“Yes, here I am,” rasped Mike, returning their
gaze. “What about it?”</p>

<p>“What about it?” rumbled the tall man excitedly.
“Do you say what about it? Have you
the nerve to say what about it? We are the ones
to say that. What about it, Mr. Riley; what about
it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, Mr. Riley, what about it?” wheezed
the fat man, digging up a limp handkerchief, and
painfully mopping around inside his collar, his
face becoming still more beetlike during the process.
“That’s what we want to know.”</p>

<p>Riley removed the cigar from his mouth, and
spat on the floor. “You’re all wrought up, ain’t
ye?” he sneered. “Goin’ to jump on me good
and hard, hey? There’s some poor losers in this
burg.”</p>

<p>“Bancrofters’ll never stand losing to Kingsbridge,”
declared Jorkins. “You were dead certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
their left-hand kid pitcher couldn’t repeat the
trick he played on us in their town last Saturday,
but he did it, and everybody’s chewing the rag.
If he can keep that up, they’ll grab the pennant
away from us. They’re getting the jump on
us at the beginning of the season. It’s plain we
haven’t a pitcher to hold his own with that man
Locke. Hoover blew up to-day. Locke got his
goat, and he won’t be any more use against that
team. They’ll keep Locke just to run against
us.”</p>

<p>“Has Bancroft ever had a losin’ team with me
managin’?”</p>

<p>“No, but—”</p>

<p>“She won’t this year, either. Leave it to me.
Don’t go off your nut so soon.”</p>

<p>“What do you propose to do?” asked Butler.</p>

<p>“I ain’t had much time to figger on it yet, but
you can bet your life that I’ll do somethin’.”</p>

<p>“I lost a hundred on the game to-day,” said
Dyke mournfully.</p>

<p>“Where did they get hold of Locke?” questioned
the lawyer.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” confessed Riley. “Cope dug
him up, and he ain’t tellin’ where. Hutchinson
don’t know no more about the youngster than we
do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps he lies,” put in Jorkins. “Perhaps
he does know.”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t take the trouble to lie about it if
he knew, and he told me straight that he didn’t
know.”</p>

<p>“Think his conscience would keep him from
lying?” asked Fancy.</p>

<p>“Conscience! If Bob Hutchinson has one, nobody
ever accused him of it. But if Locke was his
find he’d be taking the credit, you bet.</p>

<p>“Don’t nobody think for a minute that I’m goin’
to sit round and twiddle my thumbs while Kingsbridge
is winnin’ games off us. I ain’t built that
way. We’ll down ’em somehow or other, mark
that.”</p>

<p>“We ought to have a pitcher as good as Locke,
at any cost,” was the opinion of Jorkins.</p>

<p>“At any cost,” agreed Butler. “Why don’t
we have him?”</p>

<p>“Pitchers of that caliber ain’t to be picked off
ev’ry bush this late in the season,” said Riley.
“There’s other ways of downin’ Kingsbridge.”</p>

<small>MEN OF CONSCIENCE!</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">There was a moment’s silence. Then
Dyke spoke up. “We’ll be up ag’inst it
hard with our left-hand hitters if they
keep on holdin’ Locke in reserve for us,” he said.
“Lisotte, McGovern, Bernsteine, Mace—he’s got
their number, ev’ry one of ’em. It was pitiful to
see them tryin’ to hit him to-day.”</p>

<p>“Never suffered more at a game in all my life,”
sighed Jorkins. “Every time a man fanned and
those Kingsbridgers howled, I had an attack of
heart disease. Then think of them loading up
with brooms, and bells, and tin horns, and parading
through the main street! It was insulting.”</p>

<p>“Insulting!” gurgled Butler. “Wonder they
weren’t pelted with rotten eggs.”</p>

<p>“It would have been unfortunate if they’d
caught anybody shyin’ rotten eggs at them,” said
Riley. “They were primed for a ruction, and
there’d have been merry blazes to pay. Now,
gents, just you calm down, and wait for me to
straighten things out. Losin’ this game to-day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
hit me just as hard as anybody, for I had an idea
we’d bag it, dead sure.”</p>

<p>“And your confidence, which you expressed unreserved
last night, cost me good money,” murmured
Fancy.</p>

<p>“You’ve won enough in the past to stand one or
two losings.”</p>

<p>“I wish you could give us an idea what you
propose to do,” urged Jorkins.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind sayin’, confidential, that I mean
to do some chinnin’ with Bob Hutchinson.”</p>

<p>“How is that going to help us?” questioned
Butler, in doubt.</p>

<p>Riley winked shrewdly. “Hutch ain’t handlin’
a team in this bush league from choice, or for his
health, and I know enough about him to hang him.
He’s in a position to muddle things for the Kinks,
and, if I have to, I can make him do it. I’ll get
busy with Hutch to-night. Leave it to me, gents.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather beat them on the square,” said Kilgore.</p>

<p>“I never knew a lawyer to worry much about
the way he won; they’ll gener’lly grab at anything
that’ll land ’em on top. Of course, we’d all ruther
trim the Kinks on the level; but we can’t let them
trim us, no matter what we have to do.”</p>

<p>“If we did let ’em,” said Dyke, “some of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
crazy ones would feel like handin’ us some tar and
feathers. I reckon we’ll have to leave Mike to
fix things; he’s on the job.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” growled Riley sarcastically. “The
way you come at me on the street, I didn’t know
but you was goin’ to demand my resignation from
the management.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we couldn’t get another manager like
you.”</p>

<p>“Thanks ag’in.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” nodded the lawyer, “we
couldn’t. We depend on you entirely.”</p>

<p>“But, of course,” put in Jorkins hastily, “if
you enter into any sort of a deal with Hutchinson,
we don’t care to know about it. You’re engaged
to manage the team, and see that it wins; but no
member of the association is going to advise you
to go out for victory in anything but a legitimate,
honest manner. I trust you’ll see fit not to come
to me with information concerning a deal with this
dishonest rascal, Hutchinson.”</p>

<p>“And don’t tell <em>me</em> anything about it,” cautioned
Butler. “I have a conscience, and I’d feel
it my duty to protest.”</p>

<p>Riley produced a fresh cigar, twisted off the
end with his teeth, and lighted a match. Puffing
at the cigar, with the match flaring at the end of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
it, he made no effort to mask the faint, sneering
smile upon his face.</p>

<p>“You’re all men with consciences, I know that,”
he said. “I wouldn’t for the world do a thing
to make any of ye lose sleep at night. Go home
and rest easy. That’s all I have to say.” He
rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“I’m very glad to hear you speak that way,”
said Jorkins. “It lifts something of a load from
my shoulders.”</p>

<p>“Mine, too,” said Butler. “I was worried, but
I feel better now.”</p>

<small>A SECRET MEETING</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">At nine o’clock that night, Bob Hutchinson,
smoking, stood on the steps of the Central
Hotel, in Kingsbridge, and waited.
Presently two men, one stout and heavy, the other
slender and quickstepping, came round the nearest
corner, and hurried toward the steps. “Well,
here he is!” muttered Hutchinson, recognizing the
heavy man as Riley.</p>

<p>“Hist!” breathed the Bancroft manager, as he
puffed up the steps. “’Fraid you wouldn’t be
here. Let’s not hang round. Take us up to y’ur
room.”</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Hutchinson, leading the way.</p>

<p>It was not necessary to pass through the hotel
office and writing room, where there were a number
of loungers, and some drummers. They
mounted the stairs, and reached Hutchinson’s
room without encountering any one.</p>

<p>“Shut the door,” said Riley the moment he was
inside. “That was lucky. Nobody seen us come
here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>“Rather lucky,” agreed the Kingsbridge manager,
turning the key in the lock. “I’d just as
lief not have it known that you’re here. I didn’t
want you to come, but you insisted. How’d you
get here?”</p>

<p>“Gas wagon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Where is it?”</p>

<p>“Left it on the outskirts, so’s not to attract attention.
Give the chauffeur orders to drive off
an’ come back in an hour.”</p>

<p>“I tried to shut you off from coming when you
telephoned, but—”</p>

<p>“I was all ready to start. I’d made up my
mind to see ye to-night, anyhow. Shake hands
with Mr. Dyke, Mr. Hutchinson.”</p>

<p>“Very glad to know you, sport,” said Fancy;
but he dropped Bob Hutchinson’s cold hand almost
as soon as he touched it. “I think Mike told
you over the phone that I was all right.”</p>

<p>The Kingsbridge manager shrugged his shoulders.
“I don’t quite get wise to his reason for
saying that. I presume this is nothing but a
social call?”</p>

<p>“Social blazes!” growled Riley. “Think I’d
ride thirty miles at night just to make a social
call, Bob? You know better.”</p>

<p>“If you came for any other purpose,” said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
Hutchinson, “you should not have brought company.
That’s straight over the pan, Riley.”</p>

<p>“Aw, I tell ye Fancy is trusty; needn’t be afraid
of him.”</p>

<p>“I’ve had some experience,” reminded Hutchinson.
“You know what I mean. Are you trying
to put me in bad in this town?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it.”</p>

<p>“Of course, I know the result of the game to-day
raised particular thunder in Bancroft. It
must have made them gnash their teeth.”</p>

<p>“Gnash ’em—you bet!” said Dyke. “There
was an awful holler went up.”</p>

<p>“Got anything to drink, Hutch?” asked Riley.
“It’s a bit chilly ridin’ to-night.”</p>

<p>“You know I do not drink.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can order up a round for Dyke an’
me.”</p>

<p>“I can, but I won’t. The boy would see you
here, and in twenty minutes the whole town would
know it. Sit down, and make yourselves as comfortable
as you can without drinks. Here are
cigars.”</p>

<p>Riley accepted one of the weeds, but Dyke chose
to smoke a cigarette. Although they sat down,
they plainly were not at ease; there was an atmosphere
of suppressed tension in the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>“Let’s git right down to cases,” said Riley
abruptly. “You know, a place like Bancroft can’t
afford to let a raw, mushroom burg of this sort
beat it out at baseball, or anything else. We’re
willin’ the games should run close, so’s to keep the
int’rest up, but we’ve got to feel all the time that
we’ve got somethin’ up our sleeves that’ll land us
sure at the head of the column when the season
finishes.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” nodded Hutchinson, as the speaker
paused. “Don’t mind me.”</p>

<p>“I know you well enough, Hutch,” pursued the
Bancroft manager significantly, “to be dead sure
you ain’t goin’ out and tattle anything I say to
you in confidence. Well, our strongest hitters are
left-handers, and that southpaw o’ yourn bothers
’em. Kingsbridge ’u’d like to win the pennant;
but, next to winnin’ herself, she’d be satisfied to
keep us from coppin’ it. Havin’ found a pitcher
that can hold us down, she’ll keep him for that express
purpose, no matter how the games with the
other teams go. I own up that that pitcher looks
like a nasty stumblin’ block, and we’d like to git
him outer our way.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to do it!” put in Fancy.</p>

<p>Still cautious about his words before Dyke,
Hutchinson made no comment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p>“Now,” continued Riley, “knowin’ you as I
do, Hutch, I decided to talk it over with ye.
Outside of that guy Locke, you’ve got a couple
of dead ones for twirlers. Deever’s arm is on
the blink, and Skillings is a has-been. Playin’
five games a week, as you do, with only one lay-off
besides Sunday, you need three reg’lar dependable
pitchers to do the work.”</p>

<p>“What are you driving at?”</p>

<p>“Just this: To win from Fryeburg and Lakeport,
you’ve got to use better slabmen than Deever
or Skillings. Locke is the only one you’ve
got, and so you’ll have to work him in them games.
See?”</p>

<p>Hutchinson fancied he saw, but he remained
silent.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Riley, “you’ll make a bluff of
workin’ the others, but the minute things look a
bit hazy you’ll yank ’em out and run Locke in to
save the day. Get me?”</p>

<p>“And no man,” murmured Dyke, “can do that
much pitchin’ and keep his flinger in condition to
trim Bancroft.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Hutchinson frostily, “that you <em>do</em>
want to put me in bad here. If I overworked
Locke that way I’d have the whole town howling
like mad dogs. Already I’ve had instructions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
from old Cope to save the youngster for Bancroft.”</p>

<p>“But you’re manager, ain’t ye?” rasped Riley.
“Are you goin’ to run the team or let an old
Reuben like him do it? What did they hire ye
for?”</p>

<p>“An inquiry I have put to Cope already.”</p>

<p>“Y’u’re s’posed to know your business. When
a game’s goin’ to the bad, whether you’re playin’
with Bancroft or any other team, it’s up to you
to save it, if ye can, by changin’ pitchers. As I
said, Locke’s the only man you can depend on to
win games, so you’ll have to use him.”</p>

<p>“If I should tell them so,” said Hutchinson,
“I’d mighty soon get orders to go out after other
pitchers.”</p>

<p>“Where are ye goin’ to get them—now? It’s
too late; they’ve all been gobbled up—all the good
ones. And even if you should happen to know of
one that was all right, you wouldn’t <em>have</em> to sign
him. You could try plenty of ’em no better’n
Deever and Skillings, able all the time to explain,
if the town kicked, that good pitchers couldn’t be
had. What d’ye say?”</p>

<p>“I’m not saying a word,” replied Hutchinson,
with another glance in Dyke’s direction.</p>

<p>In a way, although it was far from satisfactory,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
Riley accepted this as a tacit agreement to his
proposal.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know,” he growled, after drawing
hard at his cigar, “where old man Cope ever
found that fellow, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“You’re not the only person who is curious
about it,” said the Kingsbridge manager. “One
chap seems to think he knows. A young fellow
by the name of King came to me about Locke.
He’s got an idea in his nut that the boy is a Princeton
pitcher by the name of Hazelton.”</p>

<p>Riley started as if shot, almost dropping his
cigar.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” he cried. “Hazelton, of
Princeton? Great smoke! It can’t be possible!”</p>

<p>“Why not? I should say the youngster is a
college man.”</p>

<p>The manager of the Bancroft Bullies gave his
thigh a resounding slap.</p>

<p>“Great smoke!” he exclaimed again. “If that’s
right, that old rat Cope beat me to it. Why, I
made a proposal to Paul Hazelton myself.”</p>

<p>“You did?”</p>

<p>“Sure. Biff Durgin, scout for the Phillies, told
me about that kid last December; said he was a
sure-enough comer. I wrote Hazelton a letter.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Dyke quickly, “accordin’ to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
rules of the league, you had the call on this Hazelton,
in a way. If Locke is the same guy, you’ve
got somethin’ on Cope, and you can make some
disturbance about it.”</p>

<p>Riley lifted himself to his feet, pulling out his
watch and looking at it.</p>

<p>“Twenty-five minutes after,” he said. “What
time do the stores close here? I might be able to
catch the old fox in his den.”</p>

<p>“Go for him,” urged Fancy Dyke. “That’s
the stuff! If there’s a chance to do it, it’s up to
you to protest Locke. If you can’t take him away
from the Kinks, mebbe you can stop him from
pitchin’ in the league, and that would do the business.
Shall I come along?”</p>

<p>“You may as well. If this thing really comes
to a meetin’ to decide on a protest, I may need a
witness to the conversation that’ll pass between
Cope and me to-night.”</p>

<p>Hutchinson was on his feet. “Gentlemen,” he
said, “I presume it’s fully understood that my
name is not to be mentioned in the matter. You’ll
say nothing of your visit to me?”</p>

<p>“Aw, sure not,” promised Riley. “We’re not
lookin’ to get you fired; we would ruther see you
stay right here as manager of the Kinks. Don’t
worry, Hutch; it’s all right. Let’s hike, Fancy.”</p>

<small>RILEY SHOOTS HIS BOLT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Henry Cope had a habit of closing his
store at night himself. On this particular
night his clerks had left, and he was
lingering in his cramped little office to straighten
out his books. A single swinging oil lamp burned
dimly in the front of the store. The old man betrayed
annoyance as he heard the front door open,
and the sound of heavy footsteps came to his ears.</p>

<p>“Now, who wants anything at this hour?”
he muttered. “Hello! Who is it? What d’ye
want?” He pushed the spectacles up on to his
forehead and leaned back from the desk to peer
out through the rather dingy office window, seeing
two dark figures approaching.</p>

<p>“Evenin’, Mr. Cope,” saluted Riley, his ample
form filling the narrow doorway. “Don’t git up.
I’ve just dropped in to have a few words with
ye.”</p>

<p>“Good evenin’, Mr. Riley. This is a surprise.
What’re you doin’ in Kingsbridge at this hour?
Howdy do, Dyke?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span></p>

<p>“Come up special to see you on ’portant business,”
returned the Bancroft manager, without
loss of time. “It’s about your pitcher, Locke.
Would you mind lettin’ me see the date on your
contrac’ with him?”</p>

<p>“Hey?” exploded Cope, decidedly startled.
“Let you see the contrac’? You’ve got a nerve!
If I had a reg’lar written contrac’ with him, I
wouldn’t show it t’ <em>you</em>. What’re you drivin’
at?”</p>

<p>“Then you haven’t a contrac’?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say so; I said a written contrac’. Of
course, there’s an agreement between Locke and
me. ’Tain’t necessary for it to be in writin’.”</p>

<p>“When did you enter into this contrac’?”</p>

<p>“That’s <em>my</em> business. Hang it, man! d’you
think I’m goin’ to tell you my business? You’ve
got another guess comin’.”</p>

<p>Henry Cope was decidedly warm and wrathy.</p>

<p>“Keep y’ur shirt on,” advised Riley. “Mebbe
you’ll state when you fust entered into negotiations
with Locke?”</p>

<p>“Mebbe I will—and, then again, mebbe I won’t.
What’s that to you? You ain’t got nothin’ to do
with it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be so cocksure about that. You oughter
know the rules and regerlations of the league.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
The manager or backers of any team can’t negotiate
or dicker with a player who is negotiatin’ with
any other team in the league.”</p>

<p>“What of it?”</p>

<p>“What of it!” croaked Mike Riley, twisting his
thumb into the glittering infant logging chain that
spanned his waistcoat. “Just this: I may have
a claim on Tom Locke myself, on the ground of
first negotiation with him.”</p>

<p>Cope rose to his feet. He was perspiring
freely, and the expression on his usually mild face
was one of deepest indignation.</p>

<p>“Looker here, you man,” he cried. “Just because
you’re manager of a bullyin’ baseball team
you can’t come here and bully me. I’ve got a
pitcher that can make monkeys of your bunch o’
players, and you realize it, so you want to gouge
me outer him somehow. But it won’t work, Riley—it
won’t work. You never heard o’ Tom Locke
in your life till you heard of him pitchin’ for
Kingsbridge. You never saw him till you saw
him right here in this town. Now you come
round and make a bluff that you’ve got a previous
claim on him. That’s your style, but it don’t go
in this case.”</p>

<p>“I acknowledge,” admitted Riley coolly, “that
I never heard of Tom Locke before that time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

<p>“Ha! I knowed it!”</p>

<p>“But,” said the Bancroft manager, having removed
the cigar from his mouth, “I have heard of
Paul Hazelton, of Princeton, and I hold fust claim
on him, ’cordin’ to the rules of the Northern
League!”</p>

<p>Riley had shot his bolt, and, judging by appearances,
it had struck home. Henry Cope stood
dumfounded, his mouth open, some of the color
aroused by his wrath slowly leaving his face. His
expression was as good as a confession that the
Bancroft manager had made no mistake in naming
the man.</p>

<p>Fancy Dyke chuckled with satisfaction. The
corners of Riley’s thick lips were pulled down; his
eyes bored Cope mercilessly. After a time, the
Kingsbridge man caught his breath, fumbled for
his handkerchief, and mopped away the cold perspiration
on his face, his hand not quite steady.</p>

<p>“How—how’d you ever git that idea?” he asked
weakly. “What ever give ye the notion that his
name was Hazelton?”</p>

<p>Riley was thoroughly satisfied; he knew beyond
a doubt that he had hit the nail on the head. Returning
the cigar to his mouth, he said grimly:</p>

<p>“Did you have a notion you could wool me, old
boy? It’s my business to know ’bout ball players,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
and when I don’t know it’s my business t’ find
out. I was negotiatin’ with this man Hazelton
last December. I s’pose he used my offer to pry
a bigger one outer you, which is just what the
league rule coverin’ the point was made to prevent.
That rule was adopted so players couldn’t
work one manager agin’ another; likewise, so one
manager couldn’t bother another by monkeyin’
with players he was arter. We’ll fix this up;
Kingsbridge can transfer Hazelton to Bancroft.”</p>

<p>“Hold on! Hold on!” sputtered Cope desperately.
“I ain’t said you was right; I ain’t acknowledged
Tom Locke’s name is Hazelton.”</p>

<p>“You don’t have to,” returned Riley; “I <em>know</em>
it. You can send him down to us in the mornin’.
Just to save argument, I’ll pay him the same
sal’ry you’re payin’, though I reckon it’s more’n
I offered him.”</p>

<p>He made a move to depart.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” cried Cope again. “You’ll never
git him. We won’t give him up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, won’t ye? Then you oughter know what’ll
happen. He won’t be ’lowed to pitch ag’in, and
the games he’s pitched a’ready will be thrown
outer the percentage count. You better think it
over calm and reasonable, Cope. Good night.”</p>

<small>LEFTY’S FICKLE MEMORY</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">They left him there, shaking with rage.
He heard them laugh outside the door
when it had closed behind them, and he
lifted and shook both his fists in their direction.</p>

<p>“Ye shan’t have him!” he snarled. “I’ll
never give the boy up! It’s one o’ Bancroft’s
mean tricks. They’ll do anything to get ahead
of Kingsbridge. It’s a measly shame they’ve
tumbled to who the youngster is. I’d give somethin’
to find out how that happened.”</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, a hand lifted, his head
thrown back, his mouth open.</p>

<p>“I know!” he breathed. “That must be th’
way it was. Bent King come to me and asked a
heap of questions ’bout Lefty—where was he
from, how did I find him, was he a college man?—and
all that. I didn’t tell him nothin’, but all
the time I had an oneasy feelin’ that he knowed
more’n was a good thing f’r him to know. If
Bent’s been and blowed he oughter be shot!”</p>

<p>Henry Cope did not sleep well that night, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
he rose in the morning at an unusually early hour,
even for him. When he appeared at the Central
Hotel and inquired for Locke, he was told that
Tom was not yet up, and did not often get to
breakfast before eight o’clock.</p>

<p>“I’ve got t’ see him right away,” said Cope.
“I’ll go up to his room. It’ll be all right.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what’s the matter with him?” said
the clerk to a bell hop, when Cope had hurried
away up the stairs. “He looks all broke up this
morning.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe the groc’ry business and baseball is
too much for him,” grinned the boy. “He’s
fussin’ over the team all the time. What did they
hire a manager for? Why don’t he let Hutchinson
run the ball team?”</p>

<p>Cope knocked twice at the door of a room.
After the second knock, a sleepy voice asked who
was there.</p>

<p>“It’s me,” answered the man outside. “It’s
Mr. Cope. Somethin’ important. Got to see ye
right away.”</p>

<p>In a few moments the door was opened, and
Locke stood there, in pajamas, yawning.</p>

<p>“It must be important to bring you around this
hour, Mr. Cope,” he said, with a sleepy laugh.
“Come in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p>When the door was closed, the grocer faced
the young pitcher. “Hazelton,” he said, “why
didn’t y’u tell me you had been negotiatin’ with
Riley?”</p>

<p>Much of Locke’s sleepy appearance vanished.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” he asked sharply. “Negotiating
with Riley? What are you talking about? I
haven’t been negotiating with him. What do you
take me for, Mr. Cope? Do you think I would do
a thing like that after entering into an agreement
with you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean that you’ve been dickerin’ with
him since then, but before. You never told me
that Riley had made any proposition to ye to
pitch f’r Bancroft this season.”</p>

<p>“Who says he did?”</p>

<p>“He says so. He came here last night and
stated that he had fust claim on ye, ’cordin’ to
the rules of the league, which bars any manager
from tryin’ to git a man another manager is
negotiatin’ with.”</p>

<p>Tom Locke was very wide awake now.</p>

<p>“How could he make any such claim. It is preposterous,
Mr. Cope, as you ought to know. I
hope you haven’t let that man bluff you. Why,
he doesn’t know who I am!”</p>

<p>“Oh, but he does—that’s the thing of it. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
came to my store, ’long with Fancy Dyke, and told
me just who you was—called you by your right
name.”</p>

<p>The younger man sat down suddenly on the
edge of the bed, a startled expression on his face.
For some moments he stared at the caller, as if
at a loss for words.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand how he got wise,” he finally
said slowly. “Called me by my right name, did
he?”</p>

<p>“Yep; said he knowed you was Paul Hazelton,
of Princeton, and that he was negotiatin’ with ye
last December. Now, what I want to know is if
there’s any truth in that statement. If there is,
we’re in a hole. Did you git a letter from him?
Did you write him an answer?”</p>

<p>To the increasing surprise and alarm of Cope,
the pitcher seemed to hesitate about replying.</p>

<p>“Did ye? Did ye?” cried the older man impatiently.
“Why don’t ye answer? You know
whether you got such a letter or not, don’t ye?
You know if ye answered it? What’s the matter?
Answer! If you done that, we’re in a hole.
They’ve got it on us. And to think of that, just
when we was holdin’ the best hand over them!
Speak up, boy!”</p>

<p>“I am trying to think,” said Locke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>“Tryin’ to think! Look here, you told me you’d
never done anything like this before—you’d
never played baseball f’r money. Now anybody’d
s’pose you’d had so many offers you
couldn’t remember ’bout ’em. You was mighty
partic’lar to have it ’ranged so nobody’d be likely
to find out who you was.”</p>

<p>Lefty smiled a bit ruefully.</p>

<p>“Apparently all that precaution was wasted,”
he said. “I give you my word, Mr. Cope, that I
have no recollection of ever receiving a letter
from Mike Riley, and I am doubly certain that he
holds no communication from me. You know I
did not send you a written answer to your proposition.
A college pitcher who wrote such letters,
and signed them with his own name, would prove
himself a fool. He’d never know when the letter
might bob up to confound him. It would be evidence
enough to get him dropped from his college
team in double-quick time. No, I am positive I
never wrote to Riley.”</p>

<p>Cope breathed somewhat easier, although he
was still very much disturbed.</p>

<p>“Then, even if he writ to you, there wasn’t no
negotiations, for it takes two parties, at least, to
enter inter negotiations. He’ll find he can’t bluff
me on that tack.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>“Give me time—all I ask is a few days—and I
can answer positively whether or not he ever wrote
to me.”</p>

<p>“That don’t make no diff’runce, if you didn’t
answer it. He’ll find he’s barkin’ up the wrong
tree when he tries to bluff me outer a pitcher that
fashion.”</p>

<p>“I presume there will be more or less publicity
over this contention, and that’ll be unfortunate—for
me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m worried over that. Riley’ll be sure
to let ev’rybody know that you’re Hazelton, of
Princeton, though mebbe it won’t git outside the
Northern League to bother ye when you go back
to college.”</p>

<p>“Maybe not, but the chances are that it will, if
Riley makes much of a roar over it.”</p>

<p>“But you won’t quit?” cried Cope, in sudden
panic. “If he tries to frighten ye out by threatenin’
to blow the matter broadcast, you won’t let
him drive ye that way? Great Scott! That would
fix us! It would be almost as bad as havin’ to
give ye up to them.”</p>

<p>“I am not much of a quitter,” answered the
other man, with a smile. “It will be a mighty bad
thing to have the facts made public; but, once
I’ve set my hand to anything, I seldom turn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
back. I don’t think you need to worry about losing
me, Mr. Cope.”</p>

<p>The storekeeper rushed forward and seized the
young pitcher’s hand.</p>

<p>“Good f’r you!” he spluttered. “That’s the
stuff! We’ll hold Bancroft’s nose right to the
grindstone; we’ll put the wood to ’em this year.
But I’m mighty sorry, on your ’count, boy; it’ll be
tough if you’re really chucked off your college
team.”</p>

<p>“Well, we won’t worry about that,” laughed
Locke, rising and returning the hearty handshake.
“We’ll have to take things as they come. It’ll
give me additional satisfaction now to down Bancroft.
I have a personal feeling about it.”</p>

<small>A MATTER OF VERACITY</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Near eleven o’clock that forenoon, Henry
Cope saw Benton King passing his store.
Immediately he hurried out, calling to
the young man.</p>

<p>“Hey, Bent!” he cried. “Want to see ye a
minute. Come back here, will ye?”</p>

<p>King came back.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Mr. Cope? You seem
somewhat disturbed.”</p>

<p>“Come inter my office, won’t ye? I want to
ask you a few questions. ’Twon’t take long.”</p>

<p>King glanced at his watch. He was wearing a
woolen shirt and his ordinary mill clothes, but
even in such common toggery he was a rather
handsome young fellow.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said; “I’ve got ten minutes to
spare.”</p>

<p>He was speculating a bit as he followed the
storekeeper into the cramped private office.</p>

<p>“Set down,” invited Cope.</p>

<p>“I prefer to stand, if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<p>“All right. I’ll come right to the p’int. I
s’posed you was ruther interested in our baseball
team, and I didn’t cal’late you’d do anything to
hurt it.”</p>

<p>“You were quite right,” said Bent.</p>

<p>“Well, if that’s the case, why have you been
tellin’ that Tom Locke is a college pitcher from
Princeton? Why did you go and put such a notion
into the noddles of the Bancrofters? What
made you give Mike Riley such an idea?”</p>

<p>The young man frowned.</p>

<p>“Who says anything of the sort? I have never
mentioned this fellow you call Locke to Riley, or
any other Bancroft man. I wish you would explain
how you got the impression that I had.”</p>

<p>Cope told of Riley’s visit and his threat, Bent
listening with great interest, which the expression
of his face indicated.</p>

<p>“You’re the only person ’round here,” the
storekeeper concluded, “who has said anything
about Tom Locke bein’ anybody ’cept what he
calls himself. You come to me and tried to pump
me ’bout him. You said you’d got the notion
that Locke was Hazelton, of Princeton. Now,
somebody put Riley onter that, and if it wasn’t
you, who was it?”</p>

<p>“I’m unable to answer your question, Cope;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
but I assure you that it was not I. But it is
quite evident that I was not wrong in believing
I knew Mr. Locke; he <em>is</em> Hazelton, of Princeton—isn’t
he?”</p>

<p>“Now, that don’t have nothin’ to do with it.
I told ye before when you asked me that you’d
have to go to somebody else to find out.”</p>

<p>“Which was practically a confession that I had
scored a bull’s-eye. I was right.”</p>

<p>Cope puckered his face and rapped impatiently
on his desk with his knuckles.</p>

<p>“Well, now, s’pose you <em>was</em> right, do you want
to make a heap of trouble for the team by publishin’
it and gittin’ us mixed up with Bancroft in
a fuss over him? Was that your objec’? Is that
the way you help your own town team to down
them Bullies?”</p>

<p>“Hardly. I had quite a different object, believe
me. What it was does not concern you at all,
Cope; it’s my own affair. However, if the fellow
has been using Bancroft as a cat’s-paw to help
him squeeze Kingsbridge for a fancy salary, it
will serve him right if he gets it in the neck, and
finds himself barred from both teams. That’s the
way I look at it.”</p>

<p>Cope sprang to his feet excitedly, almost choking
in the effort to utter the words which rushed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
to his lips. He was mightily disturbed, and, as
usual when overwrought, he perspired freely.</p>

<p>“But he says he never done nothin’ of the sort,
and he wouldn’t lie.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t he?” said Bent, with a faint sneer.
“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because he’s an honest young feller—honest
and square as a brick.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that? Let me tell you,
Cope, that a college man who will play summer
ball for money, under a fictitious name, is not
honest; and such a fellow wouldn’t choke a little
bit over a lie.”</p>

<p>“Y’u’re wrong ’bout this chap—dead wrong;
he’s on the level.”</p>

<p>“He may be,” admitted King, preparing to depart;
“but I have my doubts. I wouldn’t trust
him out of sight. Why, such a man might double
cross you any time. He can be bought and sold.
It may be a very good thing for the team to dispense
with his services.”</p>

<p>Having said this, he left the office and the store,
heedless of some parting words from Cope, who
was far more agitated than he had been before
the interview.</p>

<p>There was triumph in Benton King’s heart, for
the last shadow of uncertainty regarding the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
identity of Kingsbridge’s star pitcher had vanished.
He had felt before that he was on the
right track, but now he was positive about it;
Henry Cope’s refusal to answer his point-blank
question had been admission enough.</p>

<small>THE TEST AND THE DENIAL</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">At the post office, as he had hoped, King
met Janet. Since Sunday, he had
scarcely caught a glimpse of her, but he
knew she sometimes came for the mail near that
hour, and the knowledge brought him there from
the mill. As she was leaving, he joined her, making
an excuse to walk in the same direction.</p>

<p>They chatted about various trivial things, Janet
seeming quite light-hearted. He, however, was
troubled; he wished that she would speak of baseball,
which would make it easier for him to introduce
the matter that was on his mind. Coming
in sight of the parsonage at last, he decided to
delay no longer.</p>

<p>“I understand,” he said abruptly, “that Kingsbridge’s
great pitcher, Locke, is in trouble.”</p>

<p>“In trouble?” she exclaimed, surprised.
“How?” The undisguised depth of her interest,
and her all too apparent alarm, gave him a stab of
anger.</p>

<p>“Oh,” he answered, with pretended carelessness,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
“it has just leaked out that he played a
rather slick two-handed game with Bancroft and
Kingsbridge, and Mike Riley is making a holler
about it. He professes to hold first claim on the
man. If so, this town will lose the mighty southpaw.”</p>

<p>Her alarm became almost panicky.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand, and I don’t believe a word
of it. It’s only another of Riley’s tricks. How
can he have any claim on Lefty?”</p>

<p>He explained.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Janet, “is Lefty really and truly a
college man? I felt sure he could not be just an
ordinary professional player. He seems far too
refined and well bred.”</p>

<p>“He’s a college man, all right. He looked
familiar to me at first sight, but I was not sure I
had seen him before. His name is Hazelton, and
he did some pitching for Princeton this year, but
I don’t think he was a regular on that team until
the end of last season. I suppose he thought that,
coming away up here in the bush, he could get by
under a fake name without being found out.
They’re wise to him, however, and now he’s in
bad. It should end his career as a college
pitcher.”</p>

<p>“That would be a shame!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>King shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Why so? A college player who goes into the
game professionally deserves no sympathy if
exposed. He’s crooked, and he has no right ever
again to appear on his college nine.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe Lefty would do anything
crooked,” she declared stoutly. “He has an
honest face. You’re prejudiced against him,
Bent.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t prejudice,” was his defense. “The
facts speak for themselves. If he is Hazelton, of
Princeton, playing here under a false name, he’s
dishonest.”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t believe he is Hazelton, at all.”</p>

<p>They had stopped at the cottage steps.</p>

<p>“I have wired for proof,” he said grimly. “I
did so Monday, and I’ll know positively before
long. Already, however, I am quite satisfied; for
if the man isn’t Hazelton why should Riley make
such a claim? And why doesn’t Henry Cope deny
it?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think it of you!” she cried, her face
flushed and her eyes scornful. “I didn’t think
you would do such a thing, Benton King.”</p>

<p>“I wished to satisfy myself regarding the
man’s honesty,” he explained, still standing on the
defensive. “I had no intention of making public<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
such knowledge as I might obtain about him. I’ll
own up that I did mean to tell you, for I wished
you to know just what sort of a person he is.
You’re altogether too interested in him, Janet,
and I care too much for you to see you fooled by
a fellow of his character.”</p>

<p>She tossed her head.</p>

<p>“I think your motive was purely personal.”</p>

<p>“Janet!” he exclaimed reproachfully.</p>

<p>“I can’t help it! I can’t help thinking so! I
won’t believe Tom Locke is deceptive, dishonest,
crooked; and it seems that is what he must be if
he, a college man, is playing here for money under
a false name.”</p>

<p>“Just so. And, as he happens to be coming
down the street this minute, we’ll put him to the
test. Will you let me ask him a few questions
before you?”</p>

<p>She had turned swiftly to look; her face lost
some color as she saw Locke, accompanied by two
other players, all in uniforms, coming that way.
They had been at the field for morning practice,
and, after making a cut across lots, were following
that street back into town.</p>

<p>As Janet hesitated, doubtful, and ready to hurry
into the house, King again sought permission to
interrogate the man while she listened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>“If you will leave it to me,” he promised, “I’ll
not embarrass you by giving him reason to believe
we have had a discussion about him.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the girl faintly, standing her
ground.</p>

<p>Locke and his companions lifted their caps as
they drew near, and Bent, unsmiling, lifted his
hat. In a cold voice, he called:</p>

<p>“O, Locke, I say, would you mind stopping a
moment?”</p>

<p>A flicker of surprise passed over Lefty’s face.
He stopped, and his companions went on.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Mr. Locke?” said Janet, in a
voice which she tried hard to keep steady.</p>

<p>“I didn’t see you at the game Tuesday, Miss
Harting,” said the pitcher.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t there. I should have enjoyed it, but
father is opposed to the game, and objects to my
attending.”</p>

<p>“You will be missed.”</p>

<p>King’s teeth clicked, and the frigid expression
on his face was blotted by a hot frown. He measured
Locke with his eyes, getting for the first time
the impression that the man was far better set
up than he had supposed, and not quite as slender.
Also, he was struck by the conviction that Locke
was older than he had fancied; although his face<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
looked somewhat boyish—particularly so at a distance,
upon the baseball field—upon closer inspection
it appeared more manly and seemed to possess
a certain sort of dignity. Surely there was
nothing common or ordinary about the fellow.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Locke,” said Bent, “but—do you
know?—you’ve puzzled me a bit!”</p>

<p>“Really? In what manner?”</p>

<p>“At first sight of you, last Saturday, I felt that
I had seen you somewhere before. I’m sure of
it now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t recall ever having seen you outside of
this town.”</p>

<p>“That’s not strange. I’m not a baseball player,
although I am a Harvard man. Yes, there’s no
doubt about it, I have seen you.”</p>

<p>“When?” asked Locke, as if the question came
from unwilling lips. “Where?”</p>

<p>“At Cambridge,” asserted King, keeping his
eyes fixed unwaveringly on the other man’s face,
“a year ago this past spring, when Princeton
played Harvard. You did not pitch, but you were
on the Princeton bench.”</p>

<p>There was a hush, in which Bent, still keeping
his eyes fixed on Locke’s face, could hear Janet
breathing quickly through her parted lips. His
heart leaped, for Lefty was faltering, and it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
seemed that the girl must perceive the faint shade
of dismay that passed over his face.</p>

<p>“I think you are mistaken,” said the pitcher,
breaking the silence at last.</p>

<p>King laughed.</p>

<p>“You <em>think</em> so! Really? Then perhaps you
will deny that you were there?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I deny it.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say you were not there?”</p>

<p>“I was not there.”</p>

<p>Swiftly lifting his hand, Benton pointed a level,
accusing finger like a pistol at Locke’s face.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” he cried, “you will make an additional
denial. Perhaps you will deny that you
are Paul Hazelton, of Princeton?”</p>

<p>Janet leaned forward, her hands clasped, her
blue eyes full of suspense. So much depended on
the forthcoming answer! If he were to confess
that he had been named by King, she felt that
henceforth she must hold him in disdain as being
all that Benton had asserted he was. But if he
should deny it— His lips parted to reply:</p>

<p>“Most certainly I deny it! I am not Paul
Hazelton, of Princeton.”</p>

<p>The girl uttered a little cry of joyous relief:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>“There, there! You see—you see, you were mistaken,
Bent. I knew—I knew you must be! I knew
it could not be true. I was sure Lefty—he—Mr.
Locke wouldn’t do a thing like that. I’m so glad!”</p>

<p>But, although surprised by the man’s nerve,
Benton King was not jostled from the perch of
belief on which he had settled. He had thought
that the fellow, fairly cornered, would not dare
to make a point-blank denial. It seemed, however,
that Locke had elected to play the hand out,
even with the leading trumps against him. He
turned and smiled into the blue eyes of the rejoicing
girl.</p>

<p>“And I am glad to know you felt so sure I
wouldn’t do a thing like that. I trust your confidence
in me may never waver.”</p>

<p>“For real, pure bluff,” thought Bent King,
“that’s the limit! But it’s a losing game. He’s
fouled himself now for fair.”</p>

<p>Getting his breath, he spoke aloud:</p>

<p>“It’s strange I should make such a mistake, Mr.
Locke—very strange. Of course, I know that
many college players go in for summer ball on the
quiet. Just to satisfy my own curiosity, I’ve sent
for some information concerning Paul Hazelton,
who made a record by pitching and winning two
of Princeton’s big games recently. Of course, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
you say you are not Hazelton, I might have spared
myself the trouble. Still, if the friend to whom I
sent can get hold of a picture of Hazelton, it will
be amusing to make a comparison between that
likeness and yourself, just to see how strong the
resemblance may be. I have an idea that Hazelton
is almost your perfect double.”</p>

<p>“It would be rather odd, wouldn’t it, if it should
prove so?” smiled Locke coolly. “Still, such
things sometimes happen. I think I’ll hustle
along to the hotel. Good morning, Mr. King.
Good morning, Miss Harting. I trust I’ll soon
have the pleasure of seeing you again at the
games.”</p>

<p>They stood there and watched his retreating
figure until he passed from view round a corner.
Janet’s face, though showing satisfaction, was a
bit haughty and accusing as she spoke to Bent.</p>

<p>“I hope you realize now,” she said bitingly,
“that you have made a big blunder.”</p>

<p>“No,” he returned, “it was that man Hazelton
who made the blunder in denying his identity.”</p>

<p>“Why—why, do you still think—”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the slightest doubt in the world—he
is Paul Hazelton. I’ll prove to your satisfaction,
Janet, that he is not only dishonest, but a most
contemptible liar, as well.”</p>

<small>WAS IT A BLUFF?</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Kingsbridge was to play at home that
day, with Lakeport. It being the middle
of the week, the crowd on hand at the
hour for the game to begin was not more than one-third
as large as the average Saturday attendance.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm aroused by the two clean victories
over Bancroft, however, was sufficient to
bring out nearly every interested Kingsbridger
who could come; and many who knew they should
not do so came, temporarily neglecting their business.
Soothing a troubled conscience is often the
task of the howling fan on the bleachers, and if
games were never attended save by those who feel
that they have a perfect right to attend, the gate
receipts would dwindle frightfully.</p>

<p>Henry Cope arrived as the locals were getting
in the last round of practice before the contest
started. Hutchinson had his eye out for the
storekeeper, to whom he beckoned at once, rising
from the bench.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” said Cope, as he came up, flushed,
“how’s things lookin’ to-day?”</p>

<p>“All right, as far as this game is concerned,”
replied the manager, in his unenthusiastic way;
“but I have something in my pocket that’s got me
guessing.”</p>

<p>“Hey? What is it?”</p>

<p>“A letter from Mike Riley, received to-day
noon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is that so?” snapped Cope, instantly deciding
that he knew something as to the tenor
of that letter. “Well, what’s that bullyraggin’
bluffer got to say? Lemme see it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll show it to you later, when we’re not quite
so conspicuous. I can state the gist of its contents
accurately, for I’ve read it over several
times. Riley asserts that, according to Rule Fourteen
of the by-laws of the Northern League, he
holds first and undisputable claim to the pitcher
who has been working for us under the name of
Tom Locke.”</p>

<p>“The dratted snake!” rasped the storekeeper.
“He can’t gull me! There ain’t nothin’ to it,
Hutchinson, so don’t you let him git ye on a
string.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure there’s nothing to it? He demands
that we surrender the man to Bancroft at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
once, and says he has already notified you of his
claim.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he’s notified me, in a way; and I
practically told him where he could go. It’s a
put-up job to gouge us out of a pitcher that’s got
the whole o’ Bancroft scared pea green. We’ve
got ’em goin’, and they’re afraid they can’t beat
us on the level, so, arter their usual style, they put
up a job to weaken us by stealin’ our pitcher.
That’s Bancroft out an’ out, and Mike Riley’s a
good tool to work the trick for them; but he can’t
work it—he can’t, I tell ye!”</p>

<p>“Doubtless you know more about the merits of
the case than I do,” said Hutchinson calmly; “for
you signed this man who calls himself Locke.
Riley says Locke is a Princeton College pitcher by
the name of Hazelton. How about that?”</p>

<p>“Riley thinks he’s wise,” returned Cope evasively,
“but mebbe he don’t know as much as he’s
got a notion he does. Anyhow, whether Locke is
Hazelton or not, I’m dead sure Bancroft ain’t got
no legal claim to him.”</p>

<p>“I hope you’re right, of course, for Locke seems
to be a fairly good pitcher.”</p>

<p>“Fairly good—<em>fairly</em>! Why, he’s a ripper, a
bird, a wonder! His match ain’t never pitched
the horsehide in these parts.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps not; we won’t argue about that.
From his letter, I should judge that Riley really
means to put up a fight for Locke, or Hazelton,
whichever you choose to call him. He states that,
unless the man is immediately released to him, he
will make a formal protest to Anson Graham,
president of the league, and he has requested me
to call the attention of the directors of our local
association to the matter.”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ but wind. He won’t push it, for he
ain’t got a leg to stand on.”</p>

<p>“He likewise states that, in case we use Lefty
again, the protest will contain a request that all
games in which Locke plays on any Northern
League team except Bancroft shall not be reckoned
in the percentage record of such a team.
Now, Mr. Cope, if he does push this thing, and the
decision should go against us, it would knock the
stuffing out of our standing in the league. We are
also warned not to use Locke again until the question
is settled. Unless you know beyond the
shadow of uncertainty that Bancroft can’t establish
her claim, we’d better hurry the matter to a
settlement, or keep Locke on the bench.”</p>

<p>Henry Cope was greatly wrought up.</p>

<p>“Keep him on the bench! That’s just what
Riley’d like to frighten us inter doin’. If he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
could only scare us so we wouldn’t dast use Locke
for a while he’d have the laugh on us, whether he
proved his case or not. He’s full o’ tricks as an
egg’s full o’ meat.”</p>

<p>“Well, until the matter is settled, I think we’d
better use Locke as little as possible. I don’t believe
it would be advisable, under any circumstances,
to run him into this game to-day.”</p>

<p>“This game! I should say not! We’ve got
other pitchers for games like this. We’ll keep
Locke special to down Bancroft. If we can’t hold
our own with the rest of the teams with the
pitchers we’ve got, we’ll git more pitchers.”</p>

<p>The umpire was ready, and the game was on the
verge of starting, so Hutchinson returned to the
bench.</p>

<p>Despite his outward boldness, Henry Cope was
troubled, for it began to seem that Riley really
meant to press his claim, an action that would be
foolish unless he could back it up with proof. The
grocer sought Tom Locke, and drew him away
from the bench.</p>

<p>The young man listened to Cope’s words, frowning
a little, the blood slowly mounting into his
cheeks.</p>

<p>“They seem determined to make as much trouble
for me as possible,” he said. “I have a feeling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
that Hutchinson doesn’t like me too much, and
there is another individual in town who is doing
his prettiest to stir things up. Benton King is the
chap I mean. He has sent for a photograph of
Paul Hazelton.”</p>

<p>“Has he? Well, what d’ye think o’ that? See
here, Bent’s ruther smashed on the parson’s
daughter. You ain’t been cuttin’ in on his preserves,
have ye?”</p>

<p>“I scarcely know the girl,” answered Locke;
but the flush in his cheeks deepened. “Mr. Cope,
consider that I’ve been in this town only a few
days.”</p>

<p>“I know that, but some o’ you baseball fellers
are pretty swift with the gals. They generally git
their pick in towns like this, for the gals go
smashed on ’em right off. Still, Janet Harting
ain’t just that kind; she’s a fine little lady, and
she wouldn’t pick up with no stranger in a hurry,
whether he played baseball or not.”</p>

<p>“I’d scarcely fancy her foolish or forward.
She appears to be a very nice girl, indeed.”</p>

<p>“They don’t grow none better, boy. She’s all
right, though her father’d put an everlastin’ end
to baseball, if he could have his way. You’re
dead sure this man Riley ain’t got nothin’ on ye?”</p>

<p>“I’m practically sure of it. He’s bluffing, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
Cope, and he’ll lay down when he finds he can’t
drive you.”</p>

<p>There was something in the way this was said,
however, that left a vague uneasiness in the grocer’s
mind. “Practically sure,” he muttered, as
he sat on the bleachers, scarcely paying any attention
to the run of the game. “Why ain’t he dead
sure? It’s mighty odd that he should be at all
onsartin on that p’int.”</p>

<small>THE ITEM IN THE NEWS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The match did not progress favorably for
Kingsbridge. For five innings, Skillings
fought hard to hold his own, but the
“Lakers,” as the Lakeport team was called,
seemed to have his measure, and Hutchinson notified
Stark to substitute Deever in the sixth, the
score standing 7 to 5 in favor of the visitors when
the change was made.</p>

<p>Deever took it up with reluctance, for his sore
arm would not permit him to throw anything but
a “lob ball.” That slow teaser, however, bothered
the Lakers for a while; but in the eighth they
began to time it right, and drove in three more
tallies, which clinched the game. Cope heard a
man near him complaining.</p>

<p>“Lefty could have saved it if Hutch had put
him in,” declared the dissatisfied one. “He’s the
only real pitcher we’ve got. Skillings belongs in
the discards, and Deever hasn’t got anything left
in his sleeve.”</p>

<p>“But we can’t pitch Lefty all the time,” returned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
another man. “We’d be fools to work
him too much. We’re holding him back for the
Bullies. He’s got that bunch measured, and
they’re pie for him.”</p>

<p>When the game was over and the regretful
crowd was passing slowly out through the gates,
Cope sought Hutchinson.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to have another pitcher,” he said.</p>

<p>“Is that so?” said the manager. “I saw you
talking with Lefty. Is he frightened out? Is he
going to quit the league, or will he go to Bancroft?”</p>

<p>“He won’t do neither!” rasped Cope. “And
he ain’t frightened. I say we’ve got to have another
pitcher because it’s plain that Lefty’s the
only real first-class twirler we own.”</p>

<p>“Skillings will be all right when he rounds into
shape,” asserted Hutch. “I didn’t sign Deever.”</p>

<p>“Well, I did—and he’s as good as Skillings.
Neither one of them ain’t got the goods. Do you
know of any good pitcher we can get hold of in
a hurry?”</p>

<p>“Such a man will be hard to find late in June.”</p>

<p>“But we’ve got to find him!” came grimly from
Cope’s lips. “No matter what price we have to
pay, we’ve got to have another top-notch slabman.
If you can’t find him—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<p>“I presume,” cut in Hutchinson coldly, “that
I can find him if he is to be found.”</p>

<p>“Then git busy. Make the wires hot! This
town is out to win this year, if it goes bankrupt,
and we ain’t goin’ to be held down by tricks, lack
of pitchers, or anything else.”</p>

<p>“No doubt it will be wise to get a line on another
man right away, as we’ll be in a hole if
Bancroft can back up her claim to Lefty. How
did he take it when you told him what was going
on?”</p>

<p>“Never turned a hair. He ain’t worried.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t he? Well, I’d be if I were in his place—that
is, if I wanted to pitch college baseball any
more. This rumpus over him is bound to be his
finish in that line. It isn’t my funeral, but I
think he’s a fool not to hush it up if he can. It’s
sure to get into the newspapers, and then the
Princeton nine will bid good-by to Lefty Hazelton.
They’ll have no more use for him.”</p>

<p>Shortly after breakfast, Saturday, Bob Hutchinson
rapped on the door of Tom Locke’s room, and
was invited to come in. He entered, bearing a
newspaper in his hand, and found Locke writing
at a small desk furnished by the hotel proprietor
on particular request.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” said Tom, evincing a shade<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
of surprise at the call. “Have a chair.” He put
aside the pen, and turned his own chair from the
desk.</p>

<p>“This unfortunate contention over you,” Hutchinson
said, “seems to be creating considerable
disturbance. To say the least, it’s annoying.”</p>

<p>“I quite agree on that point,” nodded the
pitcher, “and it is far more annoying to me than
it can possibly be to any one else.”</p>

<p>“I should think it might be, although I wish to
state that it has jarred me some. I’d like to know
whether we have a good claim to you or not.
Have you seen the Bancroft <cite>News</cite> this morning?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Here it is. You’ll find something of interest
concerning you here in the sporting department.”</p>

<p>He handed over the newspaper, indicating the
article mentioned, and sat down. Not once did
he take his cold eyes off Locke’s face as the latter
read the piece pointed out.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The <cite>News</cite> has learned that a warm controversy is in progress
over a certain remarkable young left-handed pitcher who
has created a decided sensation by his phenomenal slabwork
for one of Bancroft’s strong rivals in the Northern League.
The man in question is said to be a college pitcher who is playing
under an assumed name, this discovery being made by
our astute manager, Mr. Riley, who is certainly on the job
every minute. To put one over on Michael Riley it is necessary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
to catch him napping, and the sleepless-eyed sleuth of
yellow fiction is a Rip Van Winkle compared with Mike.</p>

<p>In ferreting out the identity of this young southpaw wizard,
our manager found that the dangerous twirler who has twice
humbled the hard-hitting “Bans”—we prefer this abbreviated
familiar name for the team, although it is commonly known
by another—is a prominent college star with whom Riley was
negotiating as long ago as last December, and, as there is a
league rule forbidding any team in the organization to dicker
with a player who has made overtures to, or entered into correspondence
with, another team, Mike lost no time in asserting
his claim to this man. The team that has the coveted
man, however, is naturally quite reluctant to give him up,
and it seems now that the case must be settled by a meeting
of the league directors, which will probably be called some
time next week.</p>

<p>Doubtless the publicity which this contention must produce
will be very annoying to the young pitcher, and it may have
a disastrous effect upon his standing as a college athlete; for
the college man who is known to compete for money in baseball
or any other sport becomes rated as a professional and
is barred from college games. Nevertheless, more sympathy
would be felt for the man had he not played the management
of one Northern League team against another to his own advantage
in the matter of salary. Should exposure and disbarment
from amateur sports follow, there are some who
must feel that he has only himself to blame.</p>
</div>

<p>Locke made no effort to hide his annoyance.
“I doubted if Riley would carry it this far,” he
said warmly.</p>

<p>“Why not?” questioned Hutchinson unemotionally.
“You couldn’t expect him to hold back on
account of what might happen to you at college.
Any bush-league manager will give a college<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
player every protection possible under ordinary
circumstances, but there is nothing ordinary about
this case, and you’ve certainly put yourself in
bad by the course you have pursued. If I had a
claim on a coveted player, similar to that which
Riley professes to hold on you, I’d surely push it
to the limit.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether or not I have made the
statement to you personally,” said Lefty grimly,
“but I will tell you now that Mike Riley has no
claim whatever upon me.”</p>

<p>“How about the letter he says you wrote him
last December, in response to his offer?”</p>

<p>“If such a letter was written him, it was a declination
of the offer, and therefore put an end to
negotiations. A man can’t be bound to a manager
by any rule simply because he writes refusing the
offer.”</p>

<p>“Not unless that refusal is, on its face, a suggestion
or a proposition that a higher offer might be
considered. In the latter case, negotiations
would still be pending. Do you assert that your
letter to Riley gave him to understand distinctly
that you would not take any offer from him into
consideration, Hazelton?”</p>

<p>“I have not said that I ever wrote Riley a letter,
or ever received one from him; and while I am<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
in Kingsbridge I prefer to be called Locke, not
Hazelton.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Hutchinson, “of course we’ll humor
you in that whim, although you must know that
your real identity cannot be kept secret after this.
I don’t suppose you’ll deny that Hazelton is your
proper name?”</p>

<p>“I have said that I prefer to be called Locke.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII<br>
<small>THE GAGE FLUNG DOWN</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Hutchinson laughed in a mirthless
manner, no sound escaping his thin lips.
The young man had refused a direct
answer, and nimbly made his escape from the
corner in which Hutch had tried to pin him, but
it seemed that he might as well have owned up
without squirming.</p>

<p>“It’s a peculiar affair,” said the manager, after
a few moments, during which Lefty sat frowning
at the newspaper he still held in his hand. “Riley
proposes to protest against the counting of any
games we may win with you pitching. It seems
that old man Cope is getting cold feet, for he has
instructed me to fish up another pitcher or two
without delay, and I’ve got some lines out already.”</p>

<p>The pitcher lifted his eyes and gazed steadily
at Hutchinson, as if looking straight and deep into
the hidden chambers of the man’s mind, there
to read his secret thoughts and purposes. In
spite of himself, Hutch felt his icy self-control<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
melting; in spite of himself, he betrayed resentment;
and there was—amazingly—a touch of
warmth in the question he fired at Tom Locke:</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the matter? I don’t suppose you
have an idea that we’re going to drift along and
do nothing, in the face of the possibility of losing
you and having the games you’ve pitched thrown
out?”</p>

<p>“I was wondering,” said Tom quietly, “just
how deeply you were interested in the baseball
welfare of Kingsbridge. Somehow, I can’t help
fancying that it wouldn’t disturb you much if I
got it in the neck, and had to quit or go to Bancroft.”</p>

<p>Hutchinson sneered.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you got a touch of the swelled nut?
Do you think you’re the only pitcher in the business?
Winning those two games from Bancroft
must have puffed you up aplenty.”</p>

<p>“I have won games before I ever came here,
or I couldn’t have won those games,” was the
retort. “I know you are only a hired manager;
but, as long as you are taking Kingsbridge money
for your services, it’s up to you to give Kingsbridge
your very best interest and effort.”</p>

<p>The manager rose, the blaze that had flared
strangely a moment before having sunken to cold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
ashes of resentment. He had not liked this young
fellow from the first; now that Locke had dared
speak out in such a fearless manner, indicating
the ease with which he had plumbed the shallow
depth of Hutchinson’s loyalty, the man’s
hatred became intense. Nevertheless, he sought
to resume his habitual mask of cold indifference.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen plenty of young cubs like you,” he
said in his usual level, colorless voice. “They
always have to have it hammered out of them, and
you’ll have to swallow the regular medicine if you
play much professional baseball.”</p>

<p>The gage had been flung down between them;
henceforth, although they might dissemble before
others, they would make no effort to deceive each
other regarding their feelings. If Lefty were
really ambitious to get on professionally, it would
seem that he had perpetrated a shortsighted piece
of folly in incurring the enmity of his manager.
Nevertheless, rising to his full height to face
Hutchinson, he had something further to say:</p>

<p>“Doubtless, sir, there are other managers like
you; but, for the good of the game, I hope there
are not many.”</p>

<p>For something like thirty seconds, Hutch did
not stir or move his eyes from Tom Locke’s face;
but he was confronted by a pose equally statue-like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
and a gaze even steadier and unflinching, and
presently, struggle against it though he did, his
lids drooped.</p>

<p>“You shall regret those words,” he declared,
without altering his tone a particle. “Your baseball
career in the Northern League will be short;
at Princeton it is ended.”</p>

<p>He went out, leaving behind him the paper he
had brought.</p>

<p>When he was alone, Lefty took a long breath.</p>

<p>“You are right,” he muttered; “at Princeton,
it is ended.” And he laughed queerly.</p>

<p>Hutchinson left the hotel to get the air, which
he seemed to need. A man who had never known
what it meant to feel deep and lasting affection
for any human being, he could hate with an intensity
as deep and dark as the Plutonic pit. Seeking
a private booth at the central telephone station,
he called up Mike Riley, with whom he made
an appointment to “talk over business,” guarding
his words, lest the girl at the switchboard, listening,
should hear something her tongue could not
refrain from tattling. This done, Hutch walked
a while, and felt better.</p>

<p>He was, of course, not the only one who had
read the disturbing piece in the Bancroft <cite>News</cite>;
already numerous people in Kingsbridge were discussing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
that item, which provoked no small amount
of alarm, and caused Henry Cope to be bombarded
all that forenoon with questions he could not, or
would not, answer, putting him before midday into
such a reek of perspiration that he felt as if he
had taken a plunge in the river.</p>

<p>With a copy of the paper in his pocket, Benton
King lingered a few minutes at the post office,
and was rewarded by the appearance of Janet.
He showed her the paper, and saw her cheek pale
as she read the brief article.</p>

<p>“That ought to convince you,” he said.</p>

<p>“It does not!” she exclaimed, handing back the
paper. “It is a wretched slur, such as might be
expected from Bancroft.”</p>

<p>“Where there’s smoke, you know.”</p>

<p>“I’m truly ashamed of you, Bent. I thought
better of you.”</p>

<p>He flushed under the stinging remark, but stood
his ground.</p>

<p>“You will be forced to believe, in the end,
Janet.”</p>

<p>“As long as Mr. Locke has denied that he is
Paul Hazelton, I shall believe him. He has the
eyes of an honest man. He has the face of a man
who cannot lie.”</p>

<p>“I confess that he is an excellent actor, able to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
assume a most deceiving air of innocence and
veracity.”</p>

<p>“Benton King, I refuse to talk with you about
him. Where’s your proof that he is not what he
claims to be? You have only your unjust suspicions
to back you up. I should hate to think
you were concerned in the spreading of this preposterous
story printed in the Bancroft <cite>News</cite>.
Why, if I thought that—”</p>

<p>“I am not concerned in it, to my knowledge; I
give you my word of honor on that. When I first
suspected that he was Hazelton, of Princeton, I
made some inquiries concerning him; but I have
carried nothing to Riley. Since he denied in your
presence that he was Hazelton, I have not spoken
of him to any one save you.”</p>

<p>He was very desirous that, though she knew
him to be determined to expose Locke as an impostor,
she should not get the impression that he,
King, would resort to the smallest underhanded
device to overthrow a rival. He had told the man
plainly that he had sent for a picture of Paul
Hazelton. It was to be a fair and open fight to
the finish.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Janet, “I believe you. But
do not come to me with any more hearsay gossip
about Tom Locke. When you have proof I will
listen.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX<br>
<small>THE FRAME-UP</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">At nine o’clock on Saturday evening, two
men sat talking in confidential tones in
the Bancroft office of Lawyer Rufus Kilgore.
The lawyer himself was not present; he
had not even seen Bob Hutchinson follow Mike
Riley into that office. But he had loaned Riley
the key, with the full knowledge that some sort of
a secret conclave was to be held there.</p>

<p>Riley was paid to manage a winning team, and
he was at liberty to negotiate what conspiracies
he chose for Bancroft’s advantage; but, for the
ease of his conscience, Kilgore wished to know as
little as possible about such plots.</p>

<p>On this occasion, Hutchinson had made the appointment
with Riley, specifically stating that no
third party was to be present during the interview.
In his heart bitter rancor toward Tom
Locke gnawed like canker; his hatred for the man
who had indiscreetly told him the fearless truth
concerning his own treacherous character was like
a wound that would not heal. Alone with Riley<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
in that office, with the door locked, he unhesitatingly
announced his determination to “put the
knife into Lefty.” Mike listened, grinning his
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“What’s happened?” he asked, leaning back in
the creaking swivel chair and elevating his big,
flat feet on the open, littered desk. “You and him
been havin’ some sort of a diff’runce?”</p>

<p>“The cub dared to shoot his face off to me,”
explained Hutchinson. “I told him his baseball
career at college was ended, and that it would be
mighty short in this league. I shall notify the
proper authorities at Princeton, and furnish proof
that he is a professional, and I propose to put him
on the blink here so that no team in the Northern
League can use him.”</p>

<p>Riley suddenly looked doubtful.</p>

<p>“Now, look here, Hutch,” he said. “Why not
put him on the blink as far as Kingsbridge is concerned,
and let us have him, if we can get him?
As long as you get your dough for managing, you
don’t care a rap whether the Kinks win or not. If
he can keep up the pace he’s set, he’d be a mighty
valuable man fer Bancroft.”</p>

<p>“No,” returned Hutchinson coldly and grimly;
“after what he’s said to me, I’ll not give him the
satisfaction of holding a job anywhere in this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
league. Don’t you see, Riley, if he were to come
over to you and be used successfully against
Kingsbridge, he might think that he was getting
back at me? I’ve made up my mind to put him
down and out, and when it is done I intend to let
him know I did it. It will benefit you if he is
barred entirely, and that should be sufficient to
make you ready to help put him to the mat. You
don’t really need him, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe not,” agreed Mike. “I’m out after a
southpaw right now that can make this college
lefty look like a frappéd lemon, and I’ve got my
left-hand hitters practicing against a kid left-hander
with speed and curves, so that they can
pound that kind of pitchin’. Didn’t know but my
claims to him might fall through, y’see.”</p>

<p>“Then,” questioned the treacherous Kingsbridge
manager, “you haven’t any real claim?
You haven’t a letter from him speaking of terms,
or anything like that?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t,” confessed Riley. “I writ him
twict, but I never got no answer. It made me sore
to think that old doughhead, Cope, should beat me
to it, and I made up my mind to bluff the thing
through as fur as possible. Didn’t calc’late the
youngster, knowin’ how it would bump him at
college, would relish the advertisin’ he was bound<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
to get, and thought mebbe, to hush it, he might give
in, admit I did have a claim, and come over to us.”</p>

<p>“Not in a thousand years,” said Hutchinson;
“not unless you’ve really got a claim. He’s just
bull-headed enough to fight it out. I saw that by
the way he met me when I showed him the piece
in the <cite>News</cite>. He wouldn’t admit that his name
was Hazelton.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Riley let his feet fall with a thud to
the floor, the swivel chair swinging forward with
his huge body, and brought his clenched fist down
on the desk.</p>

<p>“By thunder!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Hutchinson looked at him expectantly.</p>

<p>“By thunder!” repeated Mike. “Perhaps it
ain’t!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t what?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it isn’t Hazelton. I have private information
that, being cornered fair and square,
he has denied it flat.”</p>

<p>For a fleeting moment Hutchinson seemed
startled out of his usual cold indifference, but he
quickly recovered.</p>

<p>“Preposterous,” he said. “The fellow must
be Hazelton.”</p>

<p>“I dunno. I reckoned so myself, but—”</p>

<p>“Look here, Mike, if he isn’t, why should he let<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
this controversy over him go on? Then, there’s
Cope, who thinks—”</p>

<p>“Nobody in the Northern League knows Hazelton.
Even Cope may be fooled.”</p>

<p>“How? He signed Hazelton to pitch.”</p>

<p>“But even he had never see the man. He made
arrangements entirely by letter. What if Hazelton,
not caring to come himself, sent a substitute?
Jupiter! If that’s how the land lays, this Locke
would have the laugh on ev’rybody when the
truth came out. We’d all feel like a man caught
tryin’ to spend plugged money.”</p>

<p>Hutchinson pondered. The possibility suggested
by Riley was something that had not occurred
to him, but, although he could perceive that
such a thing might be true, a brief bit of meditation
led him to reject it as improbable.</p>

<p>“You’re wrong,” he said. “I’ll stake my life
that he is Hazelton.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got t’ be sure,” growled the Bancroft
manager. “It won’t do to go ahead until we are.
Say, I wouldn’t have him put one like that over on
me for a cool thousan’. I’d be guyed aplenty.
Think of us howlin’ about Hazelton and claimin’
that Locke was him, only to have it pan out that
we’d been makin’ a lot o’ jacks of ourselves. I
wouldn’t hear the last of it in a year.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p>“Then I’ll find a way to get the proof that he <em>is</em>
Hazelton,” promised Hutch. “But when we’ve
got it, what are we going to do? I thought you
had some semblance of a claim which would give
us an excuse to get together and sign an agreement
not to use him, either one of us.”</p>

<p>“And have him go over to Fryeburg or Lakeport?”</p>

<p>“No. We could fix that by faking up a claim
that, on account of crookedness on his part, he was
suspended. A man suspended can’t be taken up
by another team in the same league; they’ve got
to wait for his release, and we’d both refuse to
release him. Settlement of the matter could be
hung up until the season was over.”</p>

<p>Riley thumped the desk again, grinning at his
worthy associate in conspiracy.</p>

<p>“You’ve got a head, Hutch,” he complimented.
“You alwus was clever at framin’ up jobs, and I
reckon, together, we could put it through. If I
knowed f’r sure Locke was Hazelton, and had
some of his handwritin’—well, I cal’late I could
get a letter faked that would cook his goose. I
know a clever guy who’d do the pen-work. You
bring me proof that he’s Hazelton, together with
a workin’ sample of his penmanship, and we’ll put
him down, both shoulders to the carpet. I’ll have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
old Cope weepin’ briny tears for his lost wizard.”</p>

<p>“It’s a bargain,” said Hutchinson, rising.
“But it must be agreed that we simply hang him
up so that no team in the league can use him.
Leave it to me; I’ll settle the question regarding
his identity, and get the sample of penmanship you
want. He’s practically a dead one this minute.”</p>

<p>“If I land that new southpaw, I won’t need him,
anyhow,” said the Bancroft manager. “But
don’t lose no time, Hutch.”</p>

<p>“I won’t. I’m too eager to fix him to dally.”</p>

<p>It was late before Hutchinson retired that night,
but still he lay awake a long time, and finally a
method by which he could possibly get hold of
some of Tom Locke’s handwriting flashed through
his mind.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he breathed. “Now I can sleep. He
attended church last Sunday; if he does so to-morrow,
I’ll see if I can’t find a way to look over
the contents of that writing desk in his room. It’s
possible I may find something more than a mere
specimen of his chirography.”</p>

<p>With this comforting thought, he soon drifted
off into slumber as peaceful and unbroken as that
of a healthy man who has no reason for a single
troubled qualm.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX<br>
<small>THE LETTER IN THE DESK</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Shortly after Sunday morning breakfast,
Hutch had a private talk in his room with
one of the two bell hops of the hotel, following
which he complacently strolled down to
the veranda, where, lounging in a comfortable
chair, he presently saw Tom Locke come forth and
depart on his way to church. When the pitcher
had vanished, the man rose and returned to his
room.</p>

<p>In less than fifteen minutes there came a light,
nervous tap on the door, and, at Hutchinson’s invitation
to enter, the bell boy, looking a trifle
pale, glided in.</p>

<p>“Well, did you get the pass-key?” questioned
the manager.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered the boy; “I slipped it off
the hook when the clerk wasn’t looking, but if I’m
caught I’ll be in a peck of trouble. I wouldn’t do
this, only—”</p>

<p>“Only you need the tenner I offered. Here it
is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>He passed over a ten-dollar bill, which the boy
took with a hand that was a trifle unsteady.</p>

<p>“Now, go ahead down the corridor, and open
the door when nobody’s looking, but don’t act so
sneaky that you’ll be suspected if some guest
should see you,” ordered Hutchinson. “Leave
the door ajar a bit. The chambermaid for this
floor is working at the front of the house, isn’t
she?”</p>

<p>“Yep; she was in Number Eleven when I come
up. If I’m caught—”</p>

<p>“Quit that, and get a move on. When I come
out, I’ll close the door. You can lock it afterward.
Stir yourself now.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later, stepping almost as lightly
as a cat, Hutchinson left his own room, and moved
down the corridor until, at the far end, he saw the
door of Number Twenty-two, which was Tom
Locke’s room, standing the least bit ajar. In a
moment he had passed inside, closed the door
quietly, and shot the safety bolt.</p>

<p>The room had not been made up, but it was the
maid’s rule to take care of the front of the house
first, and Hutch was not particularly fearful of
interruption. If she should come, she would find
the door bolted, and, unless she had seen him go
out, doubtless she would think Locke still there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span></p>

<p>Hutchinson wasted no time. Testing the desk,
he found it locked, whereupon he produced a huge
bunch of keys, muttering:</p>

<p>“If one of these won’t do it, I’ll have to break
it open. I’m going into it now, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Selecting the keys most likely to fit such a lock,
he found that the fourth one tried served his purpose.
The bolt clicked, and he opened the lid.
Although he was moving swiftly, apparently he
was still as cool and unagitated as Locke might
have been himself while opening the desk with the
proper key, which the pitcher carried in his pocket.</p>

<p>Immediately on lowering the lid of the desk,
Hutchinson’s eyes discovered something that gave
him a feeling of satisfaction. It was an unfinished
letter, written on the paper of the hotel,
pushed back and left lying under the pigeonholes.</p>

<p>“This ought to tell me something,” muttered
the man. “It’s a letter the fellow hasn’t found
time to finish, and, at least, it will furnish the
needed specimen of his handwriting.”</p>

<p>In the most informal way, without giving the
full name and address of the person for whom it
was intended, the letter began: “My dear Grandall;”
and went on to give an account of the experiences
of the writer since his arrival in Kingsbridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<p>The chirography was strong and manly, and
extremely easy to read, although not at all of the
“copper-plate” variety.</p>

<p>Hutchinson, running through the letter swiftly
in search of the proof he desired, gave little heed
to the quaintly humorous description of the pulp-mill
town, “baseball batty”; and he skimmed
through the somewhat graphic, self-chaffing account
of the first game pitched by the writer, in
which, as he laughingly confessed, he began with
“a combination attack of stage fright and buck
fever.” These paragraphs, however, he perused
without missing a word:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As I say, we have a good team, and I think it should be
a winning one if our manager is on the square and wants it
to win. For some reason I do not trust the man.</p>

<p>At our first meeting I was seized by a powerful instinctive
feeling of dislike and distrust. He is cold as a fish and bloodless
as a stone, with a voice as flat and monotonous as the
Desert of Sahara, and his frosty, unfeeling eye is not the eye
of an honest man.</p>

<p>He does not belong in Kingsbridge, but has been hired, like
the players on the team, and I should say that he is a person
who stands ready to sell himself at any time for a price.</p>

<p>If it should happen that, near the close of the season,
Kingsbridge stands between Bancroft and championship
honors, Bancroft will cop the pennant easily enough by
dickering on the “q. t.” with Mr. Robert Hutchinson—or I’m
away off my trolley.</p>
</div>

<p>It was characteristic of the man reading the letter
that he did not show his rage by flushing. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
nose, however, became a livid, sickly white, and
his thin lips were pressed somewhat more closely
together, causing his mouth to resemble a straight,
colorless scar. His face was that of a most dangerous
man who would strike at an enemy’s back
in the dark.</p>

<p>There were other paragraphs that Hutchinson
read without skipping a line:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Oh, by the way, old fellow, I have met the most charming
girl it has ever been my good luck to run across. I’m not
going to try to describe her, because I simply lack command
of language to do so, and by this confession alone you can
see that she has me going some.</p>

<p>Her name is Janet Harting, and she is the daughter of a
hard-shell parson whose pet aversion is baseball—a man who,
according to report, believes all baseball players must be either
children, fools, or ruffians.</p>

<p>Janet, however, has attended boarding school, and she’s a
thoroughbred fan, though her father raises such a rumpus
about it that she doesn’t get out to many games.</p>

<p>Benton King, son of the man who has metamorphosed
Kingsbridge from a four-corners settlement into a hustling,
rip-roaring young city-to-be, is mightily interested in Miss
Janet. Judging by appearances, she is not exactly averse to
his attentions, which, considering his prospects and the fact
that he seems to have anything around here in the eligible-young-man
line left at the post, is no source for wonderment.</p>

<p>Sometimes I think I’d like to see if I couldn’t give him a
run for his money, but—well, you know how I’m situated, and—what’s
the use!</p>
</div>

<p>“Not a bit of use, young man—not a bit,” muttered
Bob Hutchinson. “When I get through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
with you, it isn’t likely you’ll have a reputation
that’ll make you particularly attractive to a discriminating
young lady.”</p>

<p>Hutchinson was much disappointed when he
came to the abrupt breaking off of the unfinished
letter in the middle of the last page, and failed to
find anything in it that would prove that Locke
and Hazelton of Princeton were one and the same.</p>

<p>He decided at once to purloin the final page,
leaving the others as he had found them. He
would relock the desk when he departed from the
room, and Locke, missing the final sheet, might
fancy that somehow it had slipped from the others
and been tossed into the near-by wastebasket, to
be carried off by the maid.</p>

<p>In one of the pigeonholes were two letters.
Both were addressed on the envelopes to “Mr.
Tom Locke.” The first one opened contained only
the post-card picture of a strikingly pretty young
girl, who was laughingly exhibiting some fetching
dimples. Across the bottom of the picture was
written: “To ‘Big Bub,’ with love, from ‘Tid.’”</p>

<p>A look of understanding drifted across Hutchinson’s
face as he gazed at the picture, and, returning
it to the envelope, he observed:</p>

<p>“So that’s how you’re ‘situated,’ Mr. Tom
Locke; that’s the reason why you are refraining<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
from trying to give King a run for his money with
the parson’s daughter. If you were going to hang
around this town long enough, I’ll guarantee you
would forget about ‘Tid’ and make an effort to get
into the running, just the same. It may be lucky
for King that you’ll be going away very soon.”</p>

<p>He returned the picture to the pigeonhole, and
investigated the contents of the other letter, consisting
of a single sheet of paper, on which a brief
note had apparently been scrawled with much
haste.</p>

<p>The handwriting was masculine, and there was
no date line to tell from whence it had come, but
the first two words were enough to give Hutchinson
considerable satisfaction. They were:
“Dear Hazelton.” With some trouble, the manager
deciphered what followed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Don’t worry any more about the Kernell case. Wyloft &amp;
Pettengall have informed me that it will surely be settled out
of court. I’ll have further information from them in a few
days, but I’m sure there’ll be no necessity for you to come
back here until you get through with your baseball job.</p>

<p>Hope you make good up there in the bush, though you
were afraid when you left that your arm had lost some of its
cunning. Let me know what success you are having.</p>

<p class="padr2">Ever yours,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Grandall</span>.<br></p>
</div>

<p>“Ah!” breathed Bob Hutchinson. “As proof,
I think this should satisfy Riley. The envelope<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
is addressed to ‘Tom Locke,’ but the writer calls
him Hazelton in the message. That settles it. I
don’t need the envelope, but I think I’ll keep its
contents for Riley’s eyes. Now, we can go ahead
without hesitation, and sink the harpoon to the
hilt.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI<br>
<small>TOM, TOMMY AND JANET</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">In a grove upon the bank of the log-choked
river, Tom Locke lay stretched on a carpet
of brown pine needles, reading from a little
book. The sunshine, sifting through the trees,
cast upon the ground golden fleckings, which wavered
and danced as a soft breeze stirred the upper
branches.</p>

<p>By turning his head and lifting his eyes, Tom
could catch a glimpse, through an opening, of the
distant village and the mills below the dam, silent
and dozing in the peaceful warmth of the Sabbath
afternoon. So absorbed was he, however, that he
rarely paused to give attention to that view.</p>

<p>He scarcely heard the sounds of children’s
voices in the grove; sounds which gradually drew
nearer. When at last he did take note, it was
because their close approach had aroused him, but,
trusting he would be left undisturbed in his glade,
he resumed his reading.</p>

<p>Suddenly he was startled into full attention by
a voice which called:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>“Tommy, Tommy, where are you?”</p>

<p>The voice, clear, mellow, flute-like, gave him
a singular thrill that brought him up to a sitting
position. The book dropped from his hand, forgotten.
No child’s voice was that; he had heard it
before, coming from lips whose fair curve and fullness
he could not forget, and, though he chided
himself for his folly, its echoes had haunted him
even in his dreams.</p>

<p>He waited, breathless, expectant, desiring to
hear the call repeated, and that desire was quickly
gratified.</p>

<p>“Tommy, Tommy, why don’t you answer me?”</p>

<p>He was tempted to answer, but that was unnecessary;
for the branches parted, and she appeared
in full view, pausing instantly on beholding
him, her blue eyes wide with surprise, her
flushed cheeks quickly taking on a deeper tint.</p>

<p>She was dressed in white, an occasional ribbon
adding a livening bit of color, and the sight of her
figure, poised against that dark-green background,
slender, startled, entrancing, set his heart thumping.
Nor was his voice quite natural as he hastily
rose, bowed, and asked:</p>

<p>“Did you call me, Miss Harting?”</p>

<p>“Oh—oh, I beg your pardon!” she returned,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
laughing nervously. “You gave me a start. I
didn’t know you were here.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad I am,” he asserted. “Just now I’d
rather be here than anywhere else in the world.
It is I who should beg your pardon for startling
you.”</p>

<p>There could be no question, his bearing and
words marked the gentleman; if doubts had troubled
her, they fled at once. In the garb of the
baseball field he had looked well; in a suit of gray
tweed, negligee shirt, and russet shoes, he looked
far better. His soft hat lay on the ground near
the book. She, too, felt her heart beating fast.</p>

<p>“When I sought this quiet spot,” he went on,
as she still remained silent, “I scarcely anticipated
the pleasure of beholding a wood nymph.
And hark!—the pipes of Pan!”</p>

<p>The sound of music came from some spot near
at hand.</p>

<p>“It’s Tommy’s harmonica,” she laughed.
“Tommy,” she called again, “where are you, you
rascal?”</p>

<p>She was answered by an elfish burst of laughter,
followed by a rustling in the bushes and the appearance
of a head of tousled, reddish hair, a
freckled, snub-nosed face, and a pair of mischievous,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
dancing eyes that widened at the sight
of Locke.</p>

<p>“Gee!” said the boy, coming into full view. “I
didn’t know he was here. Where’s the rest of the
bunch, Miss Janet?” One soiled hand gripped
the harmonica.</p>

<p>“You see what you did by running away,
Tommy,” said the girl, in mock severity. “You
made me disturb Mr. Locke.”</p>

<p>“For which offense, Tommy,” smiled the young
man, “I’ll stand treat at the candy store the first
chance I get. While not in the least desiring to
encourage insubordination, I must say I’m glad
you ran away.”</p>

<p>Janet flashed him a look, and her eyes dropped
before his gaze. She could feel the flush in her
cheeks.</p>

<p>“I came out for a walk with some of the little
fellows of my Sunday-school class,” she hastened
to explain. “Tommy Murphy is always up to his
pranks. One day he got lost in the woods, and
they didn’t find him until eleven o’clock that
night.”</p>

<p>“Never got lost,” denied the boy instantly.
“My old man give me a larrupin’, ’n’ I jest run
off to go West an’ fight Injuns, but it come dark
’n’ I had ter camp in the woods, ’n’ they ketched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
me ’n’ took me back home. My maw, she didn’t
let my paw larrup me no more fer that, fer she
knowed I was desprut, an’ I’d said that I’d run
erway ag’in if I was thrashed any more. When
a desprut man says that, folks better be careful
what they do to him.”</p>

<p>With some difficulty, Locke refrained from a
delighted outburst of laughter. “I quite agree
with you, Tommy,” he said. “There have been
occasions when I was desperate myself.”</p>

<p>“I know, I know,” eagerly cried the little fellow.
“I seen that fust game you pitched ag’inst
Bancrof’. Gee! You must ’a’ been desprut with
the bunch howlin’ at ye ’n’ you plumb off your
pins; but you jes’ got together an’ made ther Bullies’
look like er lotter shines. I see all ther
games. It don’t cost me nuthin’; I know er loose
board, ’n’ I crawl t’rough the fence. Say,” he
added, in sudden alarm over the indiscretion of
this confession, “you won’t gimme erway, will
ye?”</p>

<p>“Never,” promised the pitcher solemnly. “I
register an oath to be silent as the grave.”</p>

<p>“Come, Tommy,” said Janet, “we must go back
to the others.”</p>

<p>“Aw, w’ats the use o’ hurryin’?” objected
the boy. “They’re comin’ this way now.” He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
lifted his voice in a shrill shout: “Hey, fellers,
come on! This way. Here we be.”</p>

<p>There were answering calls, and the sound of
running feet and crashing bushes. Seeing a
look of uncertainty upon the girl’s face, Locke hastened
to reassure her:</p>

<p>“Let them come, Miss Harting. This is as
good a place as any for them to amuse themselves.”</p>

<p>“But you—we have disturbed your reading.”</p>

<p>“There are things more interesting than books,
and I was really a bit lonely. See, there is a clean
log on which you may sit, and, if you don’t mind,
I’d like to talk to you. You’ll certainly be well
chaperoned. Of course, if you object to my company
and—”</p>

<p>Making the grove ring with their whoops, six
youngsters came bursting into the glade. Tommy
quickly satisfied their surprised curiosity regarding
the young man they found talking to their
teacher.</p>

<p>“That’s Lefty,” he said. “We jes’ run ercrost
him here by accidunt. He’s ther greatest pitcher
that ever bent er slant over the slab round these
parts. Me brudder Bill says so.”</p>

<p>“Aw, g’wan!” retorted a barefooted boy, who
was a bit larger and somewhat older. “My brudder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
Sam says Lefty ain’t so much, only he’s a
southpaw, an’ Bancrof’ ’s gotter lot of left-hand
knockers; an’ that’s how he bothers ’em.”</p>

<p>“Looker here, Jimmy,” said Tommy ominously,
thrusting the harmonica into his pocket, “your
brudder Sam was talkin’ through his hat. Anyhow,
he dunno beans ’bout baseball.”</p>

<p>“He knows as much as your brudder Bill.”</p>

<p>“You’re another!”</p>

<p>The two boys flew at each other, Tommy getting
in the first crack and following it up hotly;
but Locke’s strong hands quickly separated them
and held them apart.</p>

<p>“He said you warn’t no good as a pitcher,”
panted Tommy. “Lemme go, an’ I’ll make him
eat his words.”</p>

<p>“Aw, let ’im come,” sneered Jimmy, “an’ I’ll
knock ther block off him.”</p>

<p>It was Janet who succeeded in shaming them
into a temporary truce; but, although they promised
to fight no more on Sunday, both muttered
dire threats of what they would do to each other
the first time they met on a week day.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you ashamed to fight?” asked the girl,
reprovingly.</p>

<p>“Nix,” replied Tommy. “A feller ain’t no
good that can’t fight. Me brudder Bill says that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
Lefty can fight jest as well as he can pitch, an’
that’s goin’ some.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid,” said Janet to Locke, “that you
have set a bad example.”</p>

<p>“But not willingly,” he quickly declared. “I
hope you do not think I would engage in a public
fist fight from inclination. I assure you that the
knowledge that you witnessed that wretched affair
has caused me no little mortification.”</p>

<p>“You were justified,” she said. “I saw it all,
and there was no manly way by which you could
have avoided it.”</p>

<small>THE INITIALS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">He thanked her for the words, and secured
his hat and book as they walked slowly
toward the log. Tommy was again
blowing away at his harmonica, Jimmy was sulking,
and the others fell to amusing themselves
with a game of hide and seek. Janet sat on the
log, and Locke seated himself near her.</p>

<p>“What were you reading?” she asked curiously.</p>

<p>He gave her the book, and she glanced at it. It
was a well-thumbed volume of “The Merchant of
Venice.”</p>

<p>“My favorite when I read Shakespeare,” he
said. “I don’t know why, but I have read it over
and over. At the moment when I heard you calling,
I was reading Bassanio’s raptures on finding
Portia’s portrait in the leaden casket.”</p>

<p>Leaning forward a bit and looking steadily at
her, he quoted:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">“‘Here are sever’d lips,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">The painter plays the spider and hath woven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>His voice was low and soft, yet full and deep.
Again her eyes drooped before his. One shapely
white hand toyed with a loose bit of bark.</p>

<p>“You quote well,” she said, compelling herself
to speak calmly, almost carelessly. “You should
be a teacher of elocution.”</p>

<p>“The task would be agreeable indeed,” he returned,
“if I could choose my pupil.”</p>

<p>“You speak in the singular.”</p>

<p>“Which,” he declared instantly, “is not at all
singular, the situation considered. Had I my
choice, I’d not seek a pupil beyond this little
glade.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if you were to pick one of my Sunday-school
class, I’m afraid you would not find the task
particularly agreeable. Teaching elocution to
Tommy or Jimmy or any of the others would be
thankless work.”</p>

<p>He smiled. “I’d not care to seek so far, yet I
know it is presumptuous for me to fancy that I
could teach <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p>She flashed him a smile that went to his head
like wine and made him long to imprison the
dainty hand that was still toying with the bit of
loose bark. There was a brief silence, broken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
only by the echoing cries of the romping children.</p>

<p>“Tommy, Tommy!” she cried suddenly, “play
‘Marching Through Georgia.’ Just listen, Mr.
Locke; Tommy plays very well for a little fellow.
Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>“To tell the truth, I don’t, but, if you say so,
I’ll swear he plays divinely.”</p>

<p>“You have a habit of speaking the truth always?”</p>

<p>“It is my intention to follow the practice when
possible.”</p>

<p>“Do you think a lie is ever excusable?”</p>

<p>“One of the leading divines in the country has
said that a harmless white lie is permissible when
it shields a friend from truth that would cause
pain.”</p>

<p>“Do you know there are those who think you
were not truthful when you denied that you are
Paul Hazelton, of Princeton?”</p>

<p>“I believe that there is one, at least, who thinks
so. The doubt in Benton King’s eyes was too
plain to escape me.”</p>

<p>“But you are <em>not</em> Paul Hazelton?”</p>

<p>“I am not. I hope you believe me, Miss Harting.”</p>

<p>“I do,” she answered. “But I can’t understand
why they persist in trying to make out that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
you are he. The Bancroft <cite>News</cite> printed a piece
that would lead people to believe it.”</p>

<p>“Which is evidence that there are those besides
Benton King who wish to believe it, and, of them
all, doubtless Manager Riley, of Bancroft, is the
most eager; for he pretends to have some sort of
a claim, according to the rules of the Northern
League, upon the services of Paul Hazelton. If
I am the Hazelton in question, he means to take
me away from Kingsbridge, even though he may
fail in compelling me to pitch for the Bullies.
That’s his game, Miss Harting. When he has
pushed it to the limit, he’ll find that he’s barking
up the wrong tree, and the laugh will be on him
and the others who have fooled themselves in the
same way.”</p>

<p>Although he smiled a little, his words were
spoken with such sincere frankness and honesty
that she was shamed by the thought that even the
slightest shadow of doubt had clouded her confidence
in him. A man with such steady eyes, set
well apart; such a mouth, unmarred by the soiling
touch of guile; such a voice, deep, strong, yet suppressed,
like the softened notes of an organ—that
man could not lie.</p>

<p>“I am beginning to understand,” she said hastily.
“It is just like those Bancrofters; they are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
determined that Kingsbridge shall not get ahead
of them at anything. They are terribly wrought
up because we have beaten them at baseball, and
they’ll do anything to weaken our team. I—I’m
glad they can’t get you away from us. Do you
think we have a good chance to win the pennant
this year?”</p>

<p>“If the games are played on their merits, with
no underhanded work, I see no reason why Kingsbridge
should not stand as much chance to win as
Bancroft. You did not come out to the Lakeport
game.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“I looked for you.”</p>

<p>“But—in all that crowd—”</p>

<p>“I am sure you were not there; if you had been,
I should have seen you.”</p>

<p>“No,” she answered, glowing at the knowledge
that he had taken so much trouble to seek for her
in the crowd. “I have not seen a game since the
first one you pitched. Father raises such objections
that I have thought best to stay away, even
though he has not positively forbidden me to attend.
If I can get an escort, I shall do my best
to persuade him to let me see the next game when
Bancroft plays here. Every one in Kingsbridge
seems to think it will be a great battle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span></p>

<p>“Bancroft comes Wednesday, this week.”</p>

<p>“And you will pitch?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; I presume so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll see it unless father positively refuses
to let me go. I <em>must</em> see that game! I hope you
pitch as well as you did before.”</p>

<p>“I hope so myself,” he laughed, “although for
a time in the first inning I was almost led to believe
I couldn’t pitch at all.”</p>

<p>“I’ll never forget it,” she breathed. “It was
dreadful. The crowd was howling at you so, and
you seemed utterly unable to get the ball over. I
confess that I, too, thought you were useless as a
pitcher. But when you redeemed yourself, and
the crowd became satisfied that you could hold
Bancroft, how quickly the howling turned to
cheers! I can hear them now, crying: ‘Oh, you
Lefty!’ It was splendid!”</p>

<p>Janet’s cheeks were bright, and her eyes
sparkled with enthusiasm reawakened by those exciting
moments. Watching the movements of her
lips, revealing flitting glimpses of perfect teeth;
listening to her voice, as sweet as that of Bassanio’s
beloved maid; entranced by the violet light
of her eyes, all aglow with earnestness; he was
stirred as never before in all his life.</p>

<p>Then and there came the knowledge that she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
was the one girl for him. He longed to tell her,
but words fit to do him such service seemed impossible
to find; he doubted if they were contained
in any language.</p>

<p>The first words were trembling on his lips when
suddenly one of the romping children uttered a
cry of pain, followed immediately by other cries,
bringing Janet to her feet in alarm.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she called.</p>

<p>“It’s Jimmy,” answered Tommy Murphy, appearing
from behind some bushes. “He’s cut his
foot on somep’n. It’s bleedin’ fierce.”</p>

<p>Locke was at Janet’s side when she reached
Jimmy, who was sitting on the ground, surrounded
by the other little boys, and holding one
of his bare feet. It had been gashed by a broken
bottle hidden by fallen leaves and vines.</p>

<p>Without hesitation Janet dropped to her knees
to do what she could, but Tom was equally swift
and unfaltering in action. Whipping forth a spotless
handkerchief, he knelt to bind up the injury.</p>

<p>“It will be best to take him to a doctor right
away,” he said, “for there may be pieces of glass
in the cut. Let me attend to this, Miss Harting.
I can do it alone; I won’t need any help,” he declared,
as he observed that all the color had departed
from her cheeks, leaving them very pale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<p>“Let me help,” she urged steadily.</p>

<p>“Yuh—yuh don’t think I—I’ll bl-e-bleed ter
death, do ye?” sobbed Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Hardly as bad as that, old chap,” smiled
Locke, as he wound the handkerchief round the
foot and drew it tight. “There’s no danger at
all. We’ll have you fixed up all right. It doesn’t
hurt much, does it?”</p>

<p>“Aw, I don’t care a rap fer ther hurtin’, but it
bled so like thunder that it got my goat,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>Janet, watching, saw Tom bring two corners of
the folded handkerchief together to tie them. On
one of those corners her eyes beheld some initials,
plainly and distinctly worked; so plain and distinct
were they that there could be no possible mistake
as to what they were. She stared at them, wondering,
for the letters were “P. H.”</p>

<p>“There you are, old man,” said Locke cheerfully,
when he had knotted the ends of the handkerchief
securely. “Never mind if the blood does
come through; the doctor will stop that pretty
quick. Now, come on, and I’ll take you to him
pickapack.”</p>

<p>He lifted the little fellow lightly, and swung him
to his back. Janet rose, and followed, the children,
chattering, trailing after.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p>“P. H.,” she whispered to herself. “Those letters
surely do not stand for Tom Locke.”</p>

<p>But there was another name which they served—a
name which Benton King had declared rightfully
belonged to the man who called himself Tom
Locke.</p>

<small>KING AROUSED</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Benton King, politely invited—nay,
urged—to call on Bob Hutchinson at the
Central Hotel, dropped round that same
Sunday afternoon, out of passing curiosity, and
listened with swiftly growing interest to what
Hutchinson had to tell.</p>

<p>“I knew it!” exclaimed King triumphantly,
when the vengeful manager had finished. “I
knew it all the time, but I didn’t have the proof.
For the last few days I’ve been expecting a letter
that ought to contain all the proof anybody
wants.”</p>

<p>“What more,” inquired Hutchinson, “do you
want than what I have given you? I have shown
you the letter written to Hazelton, which was
mailed to him in an envelope addressed to Tom
Locke. That certainly nails it on him for fair.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Bent, with a nod, “but I’ll have
something more convincing than that for a skeptical
person, if I’m not badly mistaken. He was a
fool to deny his identity in the first place.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span></p>

<p>“Right; especially to his manager. We protect
college guys who confide in us, and let them
play under fake names if they wish, but this man
has been crooked with me, and there’s no reason
why I should cover him up. You should have seen
the other letter I spoke of, the one he was writing.
I read it, thinking he might give himself away.
He knocked me in it, and he soaked you.”</p>

<p>“Me?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He said you were a fellow with more
money than brains, thanks to a rich father. He
also referred to a certain young lady in town by
the name of Janet Harting; said you were chasing
round after her, but he proposed to get busy
and cut you out, as she was the prettiest girl he
had seen around here, and would serve to amuse
him while he had to stay here.”</p>

<p>King’s face was dark; his hands clenched, and
his eyes flashed. A singular ring of yellowish pallor
formed round his mouth, his lips drew back
from his teeth, and he cried:</p>

<p>“He denied, in her presence, that he was Hazelton,
and I know what she thinks of a liar. He
won’t amuse himself much with her when I am
through with him.”</p>

<p>Thoroughly satisfied, Hutchinson walked slowly
toward his window, which looked out on the main<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
street of the town. He had begun the work of
undermining the man who had dared express to
his face an unreserved opinion of him as a manager,
and when he, Hutchinson, was finished, the
so-called Tom Locke would be down and done for.</p>

<p>“I have your promise, Mr. King,” said Hutch,
“to say nothing concerning the source of your information.
I was determined to know the truth
about that man, but you can understand that the
general public might not approve of my method of
obtaining it.”</p>

<p>Suddenly he brushed back one of the coarse lace
curtains, and leaned forward to look out of the
window.</p>

<p>“I declare,” he said, without the slightest
change in his voice, “if here isn’t our man now,
carrying a kid on his back; and, on my word, the
young lady in question is with him.”</p>

<p>King crossed the room, almost at a bound,
snatching aside the curtains. True, Locke was
passing on the opposite side of the street, bearing
on his back a little boy, whose left foot was bound
about with a bloodstained handkerchief. Janet
walked beside him; the other children straggled
along behind.</p>

<p>There was a roaring in Benton King’s ears, and
a reddish mist seemed to flow across his vision like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
a filmy waterfall in the evening sunlight. Far
and wide in lumber land, old Cyrus King was
known as a man with a violent and ungovernable
temper, deadly dangerous when aroused, and, in
this respect, at least, Benton was his father’s son.</p>

<p>“I’ll do up that sneaking, boasting fellow!” he
snarled wolfishly, sick to the core with the rage
that possessed him.</p>

<p>“Evidently,” said Hutchinson, heaping fuel to
the leaping flames, “he has begun to amuse himself
with Miss Harting.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get him!” cried Bent again, burning and
freezing alternately with fury that made him
tremble. “And I’ll make quick work of it!”</p>

<p>He wheeled from the window, but Hutch turned
with equal swiftness and shot out a pair of hands
that fastened upon him.</p>

<p>“Hold on,” said the manager. “Where are
you going?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to fix him—to fix him! Hands off!
He can’t make a jest of that girl! Amuse himself
with her, will he? His pleasure will be brief!
Let me go!”</p>

<p>Exerting all his strength, Hutchinson swung
the infuriated young man to one side, giving him
a thrust that made him stagger. Springing to
the door, the manager turned the key in the lock,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
removed it, and put it into his pocket. Again he
faced King, one open hand upheld, palm outward.</p>

<p>“Open that door!” shouted Bent, his eyes glaring,
a bit of white foam on his lips. “What are
you trying to do?”</p>

<p>“I am trying to prevent you from making a fool
of yourself,” answered the other calmly. “Listen
to me a minute. Have you any regard whatever
for Miss Harting?”</p>

<p>“Have I? I’m going to protect her from that
wolf. Let me out!”</p>

<p>“Do you want to involve her in a scandal? In
your present state of blind madness, you would
rush after them and attack the man upon the
street. A common scrap over a girl on Sunday—you
know what that means. The burg would buzz
with it; the young lady would feel herself humiliated
and disgraced. Do you think you would gain
favor in her eyes by such folly? Besides, you are
no match for that fellow; you ought to know it, for
you saw him whip Jock Hoover, and Hoover’s no
slouch of a fighter. You would not make a very
heroic figure in that sort of an affair.”</p>

<p>“I can fight, if necessary,” panted Benton. “I
discharged two men last week because they left
work to attend a ball game against my orders.
One of them was a dago, and he came back, drunk,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
to cut me up. I took his knife away from him
and threw him out. I can fight, and I’m not
afraid of a coward who hides behind a fake name.”</p>

<p>“Even if you whipped him, you’d stand a good
chance of putting yourself in Dutch with the girl,
who surely would be mortified by the notoriety the
affair would bring. Have some sense; wait a bit,
King, and cool off. With a clear head, you’ll see
that there are other and far better ways of fixing
the man.”</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">The calmness of the speaker had its effect on
the trembling young fellow, who stood
there, hands clenched, breast heaving,
slowly beginning to realize that it was his duty to
do nothing that would humiliate the girl and involve
her in the speculations of scandal-loving
tongues.</p>

<p>“Let me out now,” he said, after a few moments,
“and I’ll meet Hazelton as he is coming
back. Miss Harting’s name shall not be mentioned.”</p>

<p>“That’s a bit more reasonable, but further
thought ought to convince you that there’s nothing
but folly in getting into a fist fight with him, in
which you are sure to come off second best. Why
give him the satisfaction of whipping you? You
know it’s more than an even gamble that he
would.”</p>

<p>Hutchinson looked sharply at King.</p>

<p>“Now, listen to me. You say the girl hates a
liar, and he has sworn in her presence that he is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
not Hazelton,” said the manager. “If you prove
to her that he lied, isn’t it likely she’ll drop him
like a hot flatiron? In that way, you’ll protect
her, all right, and you’ll put the blade into him,
after which any comparison on her part between
you and the man who tried to deceive her will be
decidedly to your advantage.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted King, “perhaps so, but to
think of him trying to carry this thing through
in such a brazen—”</p>

<p>“He has simply besmirched himself, and his sojourn
in Kingsbridge will be brief. Mike Riley
has in his possession a letter from Paul Hazelton,
which, as it is an effort to jack Riley up in the matter
of salary—Riley having made Hazelton an
offer to pitch for Bancroft—will establish Bancroft’s
prior claim to the man. As near as I can
learn, old Cope got Hazelton by paying him a preposterously
big sum.”</p>

<p>“If he goes to Bancroft, he’ll still be pitching in
the league and appearing regularly in Kingsbridge.”</p>

<p>Hutchinson permitted a frosty smile to fade
across his face. “He’ll never pitch for Bancroft
or any other team in the Northern League. Riley
is sore. I am telling you in confidence that we
have talked the matter over and agreed that Hazelton<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
shall be suspended indefinitely for tricky
work. That will put an end to his meteoric career
in these parts. All that was needed was
proof positive that the man was Hazelton, and I
have it.”</p>

<p>“When will he be suspended?”</p>

<p>“Some time this present week, when a meeting
of the league association will be called in Bancroft
especially to consider his case. Doubtless
you know that Riley has already served notice on
us that all games won by Kingsbridge with Locke
on the mound will be protested. As a pitcher
around here, the fellow is as good as a dead one
this minute. He has killed himself in college baseball,
also.”</p>

<p>“Which serves him right. But what will Kingsbridge
do for a first-class pitcher?”</p>

<p>“I have one man coming, and another on the
string. The first one I expect to arrive by Tuesday
or Wednesday, at the latest. If I am left to
manage this team, with no interference from Cope,
I’ll manage it right. He has messed things up
beautifully and given us a bad start.”</p>

<p>They talked until the scheming manager saw
that King, though brooding, had calmed down;
then, satisfied with what he had accomplished he
unlocked the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span></p>

<p>Hutchinson descended the stairs with King. At
the foot of the flight they encountered Tom Locke,
just coming from the hotel office in company with
Larry Stark. The pitcher had been telling Stark
something, and both men were laughing. Believing
he knew what Locke had been saying, and that
it concerned Janet Harting, the lumber magnate’s
son was again obsessed with white-hot
anger.</p>

<p>“You’ll laugh out of the other side of your
mouth in a day or two, Hazelton!” he rasped.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” Tom returned, flushing.
“My amusement does not concern you, King; and
will you be good enough to call me Locke?”</p>

<p>“No, I will not; I’ll call you by your right name,
which is Paul Hazelton. Deny it here, if you have
the nerve.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I do deny it.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re a liar!”</p>

<p>He did not wait for the retaliation the insult
seemed certain to bring, but leaped, with the final
bitter word, at the accused man’s throat. Stepping
sideways like a flash, Locke caught him as he
sprang, whirled him round, slammed him up
against the near-by partition, and held him there.
The quickness and strength of the pitcher was
amazing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<p>Instantly Stark sprang to part them, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Don’t hit him, Tom—don’t hit him!”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any intention of hitting him—this
time,” answered Locke. “But that was a nasty
word he used, and he should be more careful.”</p>

<p>Hutchinson took a hand. Two or three other
men came quickly from the office and joined in
holding the struggling, panting lumber king’s son
in check, Locke having released him and permitted
himself to be pushed back.</p>

<p>“I say he’s a liar!” shouted Benton. “He
knows he lies! I’ll prove it for everybody. Take
your hands off me, and I’ll fight him here or anywhere
else. I dare him to meet me like a man!
He hasn’t the courage! He’s a coward!”</p>

<p>“You’re plumb anxious to get your face broke,
ain’t ye?” snapped Larry Stark. “You wouldn’t
last a minute with him. What’s eating you, anyhow?”</p>

<p>The hotel proprietor indignantly announced
that he did not propose to have a fight in his
house.</p>

<p>“I’m surprised, Mr. King, that you should start
trouble here,” he said. “I ask you, as a gentleman,
to quit it.”</p>

<p>“All right, Mr. Sawyer,” said Bent. “As you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
have put it up to me that way, it goes. Take your
hands off me, everybody. I won’t touch him
again—here.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t notice that you touched him at all,”
grinned Stark.</p>

<p>“But,” declared King, smoothing his rumpled
coat and straightening his necktie, “I’m not done
with him, as he is due to find out. I’ll get him
yet, and get him good.”</p>

<p>After giving Locke a parting look of venomous
hatred, the young man turned toward the open
door and passed out.</p>

<small>THE PHOTOGRAPH</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Benton King sat in his office at the mill,
opening the morning mail, which had just
been brought him by a boy. His face
wore a heavy frown, and he ripped open the envelopes
viciously with the steel paper cutter.</p>

<p>The sounds of the mill—the creaking of the
windlass drawing the big sticks up the run, the
scream of the saws tearing through logs, the pistol-claps
of fresh-cut boards tossed flatly upon other
boards by the laborers—annoyed him, and he rose
and kicked shut the connecting door, which had
been left slightly ajar.</p>

<p>Resuming his seat at the desk, his eye fell on a
square, flat package at the bottom of the letters
remaining unopened, and he caught it up eagerly.</p>

<p>“Ha!” he breathed, after looking at the address.
“Fletcher’s handwriting! He got it!
This is what I sent for.”</p>

<p>Even as he was tearing off the wrapper, however,
hesitation and fear came upon him. What
if it should not be what he wanted? What if the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
photograph he knew the wrapping contained were
not that of the man he had accused? The possibility
gave him a gripping throb that was keen as
the thrust of steel.</p>

<p>“It must be,” he muttered huskily. “I can’t
be wrong. He has put up a big bluff, but he’s the
man.”</p>

<p>His hands were not wholly steady as he finished
removing the wrapper of brown manila. The picture
was faced with cardboard, and this he flung
aside, revealing the printed likeness that had been
caught by the camera. Snatching it up, he turned
eagerly to permit the light to fall full upon it. His
face flamed with triumph; his mouth opened, but
no sound issued forth; his clenched fist rose and
fell on the desk as if the blow settled the doom of
a mortal foe. After a time he laughed; it was not
a pleasant laugh.</p>

<p>Presently, when he had gazed until satisfied that
even the most obtuse or most obstinate could not
behold it and express a doubt as to the almost perfect
likeness of the picture to the man who called
himself Tom Locke, a likeness far stronger than
a mere verisimilitude, he turned again swiftly to
the letters that had not yet been opened. Running
them over, he selected one on which the writing
corresponded to that upon the wrapper that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
had been removed from the photograph. No time
was wasted in opening it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">New York</span>, June 28, 19—.<br></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Bent</span>: Found an opportunity yesterday to run out
to Princeton and get the photograph of Paul Hazelton, which
you desire so urgently, and I am sending it under separate
cover, letter rates, so it will travel along without delay. Why
didn’t you tell me more fully what you want of the thing?
Night letters by wire are cheap, and even a brief explanation
would not have left me puzzling my brains in weather
that will hatch eggs without the assistance of either setting
hen or incubator. You’re lucky to be up there in the open
pastures on the border of the big woods, where you can
breathe without fancying you are stoking an Atlantic liner.</p>

<p class="padr2">Crisply,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Fletch</span>.<br></p>
</div>

<p>“Good old Fletch!” chuckled Bent. “I’ll write
him about it later. He has done me a great service,
and Janet, also. This settles the matter beyond
any question or dispute.”</p>

<p>He looked at his watch; it was nine-thirty.
Late enough for him to see Janet, he decided, and,
thrusting the letter and the photograph into his
pocket, he rose from the desk, leaving the remainder
of the mail unopened.</p>

<p>The screams of the mill saws followed him into
the streets of the town, and at times it seemed as
if their cries of conquering triumph took on something
resembling entreaty or warning, but his
hurrying feet did not falter, and soon he was ringing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
at the parsonage door. The white-capped
maid answered and said she would find out if Miss
Harting could see him. He entered and waited.</p>

<p>He did not have to wait long before Janet appeared,
his heartstrings giving a tug as he beheld
her in a simple morning gown. In her blue eyes
there was a look of wonder, not wholly free from
apprehension.</p>

<p>“I—I could hardly believe you were here—so
early,” she said, scanning his face as if seeking to
find there some explanation of this unusual call.
“Has—has anything happened?”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon for coming at this hour,” he
returned, “but I simply couldn’t wait. I hope
you understand me and believe me, Janet, when I
say that I am your sincere friend, something I
hope to prove to your entire satisfaction. Taking
the privilege of a friend whose motives cannot
be questioned, I must tell you how much I regret
having seen you yesterday with the man who calls
himself Locke.”</p>

<p>Her face did not harden, for there was nothing
of hardness in her nature, but it changed, warning
him that he was treading on most dangerous
ground. She lifted her hand quickly, retreating
a step.</p>

<p>“If that is what brings you here, I am sorry you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
came. I met Mr. Locke quite by accident while
out walking with the children. Jimmy Bryant cut
his foot frightfully on a broken bottle, and Mr.
Locke bound it up and brought him in to the doctor.
I hardly know why I should make this explanation.”</p>

<p>“You could not be seen with the man without
arousing more or less comment, and you should
know what the gossips of this town will say.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Locke has satisfied me that he is a thorough
gentleman, and unwarranted gossip of narrow-minded
persons who are eager for something
to talk about cannot frighten me.” The color
was in her cheeks now.</p>

<p>“A gentleman!” cried Bent, losing his head for
a moment. “That two-faced sneak a gentleman!
That man who has boasted already that, as you
happen to be the prettiest girl in town, he proposes
to amuse himself with you! He thinks himself
a crusher, the sort that girls get stuck on.
He has the post-card photograph of one now, who
signs herself ‘Tid,’ doubtless a silly creature he
has flattered and fooled with his lying tongue.
And now he proposes to get you on the string
and—”</p>

<p>“Stop, Benton King!” Her cheeks had lost
the flush, and there was something in her voice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
he had never heard before. “Whatever your motive,
you are making a blunder. How do you
know these things you are saying?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI<br>
<small>CRUMBLED CASTLES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Fearing what she might think of him for
dealing with a man like Hutchinson, he
dared not tell her just how the knowledge
had come to him; but he swore it was true, that he
knew it was true, and begged her to believe him.</p>

<p>“And, though he has denied it, he is Paul Hazelton.
They have the absolute proof, and Mike
Riley holds a letter of his that will bar him from
baseball in the Northern League. There’ll be a
meeting called this very week, and he’ll be suspended.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe it, I told you not to speak to
me again about him until you could show proof
that—”</p>

<p>“I can! I have it here!”</p>

<p>Exultantly he produced the letter and photograph;
the latter he held before her eyes, and she
looked at it, speechless.</p>

<p>“The picture of Paul Hazelton, of Princeton,”
he said. “Does it resemble Mr. Tom Locke?”</p>

<p>“Where—where did you get it?” she asked in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
a husky whisper, taking it from his hand with
nerveless fingers that nearly let it fall.</p>

<p>“I told you I had sent to a friend, asking him to
get Hazelton’s picture for me. He went to Princeton
for it; here’s the name of the Princeton photographer
on it.”</p>

<p>She had hoped that there might be some doubt;
that, even though the photograph resembled
Locke, there might be some question as to whether
it was not the counterfeit presentment of a person
who looked like him. But, with it before her eyes,
that hope sank and died; it was the man.</p>

<p>Watching her face, King felt certain he had won
at last. He took the picture, and placed the open
letter in her hands. She tried to read it, but the
lines ran into a blurred mass, and finally, with a
choking sensation in her throat, she handed it
back, endeavoring to keep him from seeing how
hard she was hit.</p>

<p>He sought to crush back and control his exultation;
did his best to prevent any touch of it from
creeping into his voice.</p>

<p>“While I am sorry, Janet, that you were deceived,
even for a minute, by the fellow, I am also
glad that no real harm has been done. He has
been exposed in time. I knew from the first that
he lied brazenly when he denied that he was Hazelton,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
but he certainly can assume a plausible manner
which might fool almost anybody. Henry
Cope knew, all along, that he was not what he represented
himself to be, but, on account of Riley’s
claim, and to protect Hazelton, he would not tell
the truth. It is useless for him to hold back any
longer. I hope you do not blame me, Janet; I’m
sure you won’t when you have time to think it all
over calmly. I care for you more—much more—than
I have ever let you know, and for that reason
I—”</p>

<p>“Please don’t say anything more to me now,”
she entreated, her voice low but steady. “You
were right.”</p>

<p>Half turning away, she put out her hand; he
seized it quickly, and found it cold.</p>

<p>“I’ll not say anything more now,” he breathed,
close to her shoulder, holding the hand fast in his
grasp; “but some time, Janet—some time when
you are ready to listen—I’ll have something more
to say.”</p>

<p>On the street he swung off with a free, vigorous
stride, his heart beating high. He had won; he
was sure of it. The knowledge of her interest in
the man, which he had feared might develop into
something deeper, had led him to realize the full
extent of his own regard for her. She was a poor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
clergyman’s daughter, and he was the son of Cyrus
King, but the little god had winged his arrow
straight, and the wound was deliciously deep.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes after King left, Janet, having
donned hat and wrap, came out and walked swiftly
down the street. Her face was chill and sad; she
was deserted by hope; yet she would see Henry
Cope.</p>

<p>Behind his counter, the grocer peered at her
over his glasses.</p>

<p>“Mornin’, Janet,” he said cheerfully. “’Nother
ruther nice day.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Cope, I’d like to speak with you a moment
privately.”</p>

<p>Surprised, he took note of her pallor and the
girl’s troubled look. Her voice had an unusual
sound. Pushing up his spectacles, he came from
behind the counter.</p>

<p>“Step inter my office,” he invited.</p>

<p>In the office he urged her to sit down, saying
she looked tired; but she preferred to stand.</p>

<p>“I’ll bother you only a minute,” she said.</p>

<p>“No bother at all—no bother. What can I do?
Anything the matter?”</p>

<p>“I have come to ask you, confidentially, about—about
the man who is called Tom Locke.” She
half turned her head away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<p>“Eh? Oh, him? What you want t’ know?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Cope, I want you to tell me the truth.
You need not fear that I will repeat anything you
say. You have always been my friend, and now,
as such, I ask you to answer my question. I hope
you’ll not refuse or put me off.”</p>

<p>“You bet I’ve alwus been your friend, little
girl,” he returned earnestly. “What’s the question?”</p>

<p>“You engaged Mr. Locke for the baseball team,
and you know who he is. They are saying he is a
Princeton College man by the name of Hazelton.
Tell me, Mr. Cope, if that is true.”</p>

<p>“Now, what makes the difference who he is?”
spluttered the grocer, frowning. “I’m bein’ pestered
to death about him.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry; I didn’t mean to pester you. I
gave you my word I would not repeat anything
you told me, but if you will not answer my question—”</p>

<p>“Hold on, Janet; I ain’t said I wouldn’t answer
it. I know you won’t tell if you say ye won’t, and,
anyhow, it’s beginnin’ to look like he’d have to
sail under his own colors before long. Yes, Miss
Janet, he’s Paul Hazelton. I agreed t’ keep mum
’bout it so’s he wouldn’t git inter a mess ’bout
pitchin’ for his college; but what’s the use, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
Mike Riley raisin’ high jinks an’ claimin’ he’s got
a holt on the boy, and even settin’ the newspapers
to buzzin’? I’m ruther sorry for Hazelton, but I
s’pose he knew he was takin’ a chance when he
come here.”</p>

<p>“That’s all,” said the girl; “thank you. Now,
I hope you’ll not tell anybody that I came to you
to inquire about him?”</p>

<p>“Not a peep, little girl. He’s a mighty nice
feller, I’ll say that fer him. Don’t seem to have
no bad habits, an’ goes t’ church, an’—”</p>

<p>But she did not wait to hear him enumerate the
virtues of the man who had looked straight into
her eyes and lied without a tremor; the man who
was proud of his conquests with the fair sex, and
had boasted that he would amuse himself with her
while in Kingsbridge. What a despicable creature
the fellow was! She left the store.</p>

<p>On the way back home, Janet passed several
persons without noticing them at all, but she kept
her face set with the fixed purpose of preventing
any one who saw her from imagining that she was
fighting back a flood of tears. Glad that her
father was out for a morning walk, she avoided
the maid, hurried to her room, locked the door, and
permitted the flood to burst the restraining
gates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span></p>

<p>After a time, having “cried it out,” she sat in
an easy-chair near the window, watching a mother
robin on her nest in the tree outside.</p>

<p>She was not thinking of the robin, however; she
was thinking of yesterday and the meeting in the
woods—a day she had thought the happiest of her
life. She was thinking of the manner in which
Locke had looked at her with those clear, honest
brown eyes, and how she had thrilled beneath that
look. She was thinking of his voice as, sitting on
the log and leaning toward her, he had quoted
the words of Bassanio, causing the heart, now cold
and heavy in her breast, to leap and throb until it
seemed that he must hear its joyous beating.</p>

<p>No man had ever stirred her like that, and something
told her that no other man could so stir her
again. And all the time he had been playing with
her—amusing himself!</p>

<p>That day, “the happiest of her life,” was a day
to regret; a day to forget—if she could forget it.
Would the sun ever again shine as brightly?
Would the woods ever seem so shadowy cool and
inviting? Would the flowers ever be so fair and
sweet?</p>

<p>She had loved the world and everything in it,
and her blood had danced in her veins, and her
feet had longed to dance, despite it being the Sabbath<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
day; her very soul had seemed to sing with a
joy as wide as eternity.</p>

<p>Now the sun was shining outside her window,
but there was something gone from its golden glamour;
her blood that had danced flowed chill in
her body, and her heart was full with a pain too
great for it to contain.</p>

<p>“A dream,” she whispered dully—“nothing but
a dream. It is over!”</p>

<small>THE BELL BOY</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">On Wednesday Bancroft was to play again
in Kingsbridge, and Thursday was to be
the “middle of the week lay-off” for both
the Bullies and the Kinks.</p>

<p>Tuesday’s early mail brought Henry Cope a
letter bearing the Bancroft postmark, and he
opened it somewhat nervously. As he apprehended,
it contained a communication from Anson
Graham, president of the Northern League, giving
notice that there would be held at the office of
Rufus Kilgore, in Bancroft, on Thursday evening,
at eight o’clock, a meeting of the league directors
to consider the protest of Manager Riley relative
to Paul Hazelton, “playing with Kingsbridge
under the assumed name of Tom Locke.”</p>

<p>“By gum!” growled the grocer disgustedly.
“They actually do mean business. We’re up
ag’inst it. The boy better know ’bout this right
away.”</p>

<p>He found Locke making ready to start for Fryeburg,
where the team was to play that afternoon.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
The young man seemed strangely depressed, and
his face wore a deep frown as he read the notice,
which Cope had handed him. The grocer
anxiously regarded the expression on the pitcher’s
face.</p>

<p>“Well?” he asked, as Tom returned the notice.</p>

<p>“It is fortunate,” said Locke grimly, “that I
fancied this meeting might be called on short notice,
and made preparations for it.”</p>

<p>“Hey? You’ve made preparations?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Whut sort o’ preparations?”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, Mr. Cope; I shall be ready for
them, I think.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re dead sartin old Riley ain’t got no
holt on ye?”</p>

<p>“How many times,” asked the young pitcher
impatiently, “must I tell you so, Mr. Cope?”</p>

<p>“You know it’s got round somehow that you’ve
denied p’int-blank that you’re Hazelton, and some
folks—they’s alwus that kind in ev’ry town—are
sayin’ they reckon you lied,” stammered
the grocer. “You ain’t never denied that your
name’s Hazelton, have ye?”</p>

<p>Tom Locke frowned, but made no answer to the
question.</p>

<p>“As fur’s I’m concerned,” said Cope, “when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
they’ve tried to corner me, I’ve dodged or refused
to answer. It’s too bad, boy; I’m mighty sorry
it’s all goin’ to come out who ye be, but ’twarn’t
my fault. I’ve kep’ my part of our agreement.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any doubt of that. It’s simply the
result of unfortunate circumstances and the determination
of somebody to do me a bad turn.
Mr. Cope, I’m not a trouble breeder, but, as you
have used me square and I am genuinely interested
in the team, I’m going to give you a tip to
keep an eye on your manager. Nor does this come
wholly, or even mainly, from the fact that I do
not like him personally; I have reasons to believe
that he is not on the level.”</p>

<p>“Hum!” grunted the grocer; “we hired him on
good recommendation, but I don’t mind tellin’ you
privately that I’ve got a feelin’ myself that he
ain’t to be trusted too fur. He’s fer puttin’ you
on the bench until arter this fuss over you is settled,
an’ that don’t sound good t’ me. I want you
to pitch agin’ Bancroft ag’in to-morrer.”</p>

<p>“And I want to pitch against them,” said Tom
warmly; “but you’ll find that Hutchinson will object.”</p>

<p>“As long as you insist that they can’t count out
the games that you win, I’m goin’ to set on the
bench myself an’ see that you pitch to-morrer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span></p>

<p>“Good! I hope I’m in my best form, for I hear
that Riley has had his men batting industriously
in practice against a left-handed pitcher. Being
left-handed helped me against his left-handed hitters
at first before I had them sized up; but I’ve
made a study of them for weak spots, and, though
they are called sluggers, he has no Wagners or
Lajoies—men who can bump any kind of a ball
that comes within reach of their bats. They have
their failings, every one of them, and, with good
control and good support, I should be able to take
another fall out of them.”</p>

<p>The door of the room had been left slightly ajar
by Cope. Outside that door a hesitating bell boy
stood listening to the talk of the two men. Hearing
some one turn the knob of a door farther along
the corridor, the boy hastily lifted his hand and
knocked. At Locke’s call, he pushed the door
open, and entered.</p>

<p>“Hello, Sam,” said the pitcher. “On the bed
there—that suit needs pressing; take it to the
tailor, will you, and tell him I want it back to-night?
Here!”</p>

<p>He extended a silver half dollar, but the boy,
who had gathered up the suit of dark-blue serge
from the bed, drew back, looking confused.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Sam?” asked Locke, a bit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
impatiently. “You’ve been doing some little
favors for me of late.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather not take it, sir,” said the boy, his
lids lowered and his gaze on the floor. “I hope ye
don’t mind, sir.”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t understand—”</p>

<p>“You—you was good to my little brother,
Jimmy, when he cut his foot, and—and I’d rather
not take anything, sir.”</p>

<p>Locke laughed for the first time that day, slipping
the piece of silver into the genuinely unwilling
hand of the boy.</p>

<p>“I reckon I owe Jimmy and his friends something,
instead of the shoe being on the other foot,”
he said enigmatically. “So Jimmy is your
brother? I didn’t know that. You haven’t a high
opinion of me as a pitcher, have you, Sam?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was jest talkin’ to hear myself talk,”
answered the boy quickly, his face turning crimson.
“Did Jimmy tell you that?”</p>

<p>“I overheard it quite by accident. How’s his
foot?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he ain’t caperin’ round on it much yit;
but it’ll be all right pretty soon. I wisht you’d
take this half back. Paw, he asked the doc, and
the doc, he said there warn’t nothin’ t’ pay for
tendin’ Jimmy’s foot, ’cause you had paid; an’ I’d<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
like ter do somethin’ to sorter make it square.”</p>

<p>“All right; keep the half now, and we’ll begin
afresh. Now that I know I can do it, I’ll impose
on you frightfully; I’ll keep you hopping for
me in great shape. Say, hustle along and get that
suit to the tailor, or he’ll not have it pressed
for me to wear this evening; and I may want it.”
He swung the door wide open, pushed the boy out,
and closed it behind him.</p>

<p>“Fust time,” observed Henry Cope, “I ever
knew a Bryant t’ try to refuse money. They’re
a pretty shif’less, worthless bunch, that family.”</p>

<small>“AND DID NOT UNDERSTAND”</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">A short time later, with his playing suit
in the hand bag he carried, Locke left the
hotel and started for the railway station,
where he would join the other members of the
team, all of whom, save Hutchinson and himself,
were stopping at a boarding house. As he swung
down the street, Janet Harting came out of a store
and turned toward him. He saw her, and his
heart jumped. She saw him, and in a moment she
turned squarely around and hastened the other
way, vanishing beyond the first corner.</p>

<p>He knew she had seen him this time and deliberately
avoided him; there could be no question
about it. The evening before he had come upon
her suddenly on the street, lifted his hat, and
spoken; but she had passed on without a word or
a token to betray that he had been observed.</p>

<p>Although it seemed impossible then that she
had failed to see him, he was not positive; now,
however, he knew, and the knowledge left him
breathless and dazed. When he reached the corner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
beyond which she had disappeared she was
far along the street, and hurrying as if in great
fear that he would pursue her.</p>

<p>“It’s too much for me,” he murmured. “It’s
got me guessing. There’s no getting around it,
she dodged me. Why? She saw me last night,
and did not speak. Why? I can hardly believe
it of her. What have I done? She is the last
person I’d ever fancied would do anything of the
sort.”</p>

<p>He did not long remain in doubt, for he was not
a dull-witted man. The controversy about him
was the cause of it all; she had heard what every
one in Kingsbridge who took the slightest interest
in baseball had heard, and she believed that he
had spoken falsely to her. Impulsive, indignant,
scornful, she wished to have nothing further to
do with a man who could look straight into her
eyes and tell her an untruth without a blush or as
much as the turning of a hair.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” he said. “There’s no other explanation.
I must call on her this evening, after
we get back, and tell her the straight truth.”</p>

<p>The truth! If he had not been truthful, was he
silly enough to fancy penitence would help him
now?</p>

<p>The day proved tiresome and wretched for Tom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
Locke, and it was far from satisfactory for his
teammates, with Fryeburg winning through a
ninth-inning rally that tied the score and a batting
streak in the tenth which earned them the run they
needed, with only one out. Stark, seeing the
pitcher had wilted, and fearing the batters who
were coming up, asked Hutchinson to call Lefty
in to save the day; but the manager grimly refused.</p>

<p>The train bore the defeated players back to a
late supper in Kingsbridge, for up there supper
was the evening meal. On the way, Jack Hinkey
asked if any one had heard anything about Bancroft’s
new pitcher, and the others confessed that
they had not.</p>

<p>“Feller tole me t’-day,” said Hinkey, “that
Riley had signed a new twirler who’d be run in
agin’ us t’-morrer. An’ he’s a port-side flinger
by the name of Craddock. Anybody ever hear of
him?”</p>

<p>They confessed that they had not. Locke was
the only man who did not answer. Sitting some
seats ahead of the others and on the opposite side
of the car, he was gazing glumly out at the whirling
landscape, his face as dark as the purple
shadows hovering at the base of a distant line of
hills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span></p>

<p>“Hey, Tom,” called Larry Stark, “did you get
what Hink was telling us?”</p>

<p>Locke started, shook himself a bit, and turned.</p>

<p>“I was thinking just then,” he said. “What
was it?”</p>

<p>They told him, and he acknowledged that he
knew of no pitcher by the name of Craddock.</p>

<p>“They say he’s a hot article,” said Hinkey.
“Feller that tole me ’bout him seemed to think we
was goin’ to git up ag’inst the real thing t’-morrer.”</p>

<p>“What you tryin’ to do,” growled Sockamore,
“frighten Lefty? Look at him. He’s fergot
about Craddock a’ready.”</p>

<p>Locke was again gazing out of the window in a
preoccupied, moody manner.</p>

<p>“Whut’s the matter with him?” wondered
Hunchy Oulds. “He’s been like that ’most all
day. He must be in love—or sick.”</p>

<p>“Same t’ing,” grinned Labelle.</p>

<p>“Hope he don’t go gittin’ off his feed now,”
muttered Hinkey. “He’s due t’ git his bumps
some time, but I’d like ter see him pull through
t’-morrer, ’specially if they do spring a new
pitcher on us.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Reddy Crandall, “Hutch won’t
work him to-morrow. I was told by a Fryeburger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
that there was a meetin’ comin’ on for Thursday
to settle whuther Lefty belongs to us or not, and
maybe the games he’s pitched won’t be counted.”</p>

<p>“They can’t throw them out!” snapped Stark
savagely. “They’ve got to count them. And if
we lose Locke we’re going to be in bad.”</p>

<p>“You mean Hazelton, don’t ye?” grinned Hinkey.
“They say it’s settled that that’s his right
name. As a rule, I don’t think much of college
guys, but I own up that Lefty is some pitcher, and
we’ll miss him.”</p>

<p>Despite his words, his tone was not suggestive
of worriment. Hinkey was one of the men
brought to the team by Bob Hutchinson.</p>

<p>Tom Locke did not eat much that night. He
hurried to the dining room at the Central Hotel.
Two cups of coffee, hot and strong, made the
greater part of his meal. They steadied him.</p>

<p>Dashing up to his room, he found the blue serge
suit, freshly pressed and carefully laid out on his
bed. It took him twenty minutes to make a complete
change, even though he was possessed by an
almost feverish desire to hurry. And, as a rule,
when he hurried he could do it in half that time.</p>

<p>Taking a final peep at himself in the mirror, he
extinguished the light and went out. When bidding
him adieu on Sunday, the girl had invited him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
to call some time, and he proposed to do so this
evening.</p>

<p>As he drew near the parsonage, however, he
faltered, and his pace slackened. She had
shunned him upon the street; would she not refuse
to see him now?</p>

<p>“She must give me a chance to explain,” he
muttered desperately. “Surely she’ll do that. I
can’t believe she’ll decline to see me for a few
minutes, at least.”</p>

<p>Locke’s pulse beat rapidly. With his handkerchief
he wiped his forehead. It was ridiculous, of
course, for a man like him to flush and shiver like
a big boy suffering from his first attack of calf
love; but, try as he might, he could not steady
himself as he approached the cottage and discovered
that, though the curtains were drawn, there
was a light in the parlor.</p>

<p>Perhaps Benton King was there! Well, what
of it? Was he the man to turn back and leave
the field to a rival? Were King there, it was all
the more reason why he should make haste to put
himself right in her eyes. His jaws set, he followed
the walk to the front door, and rang.</p>

<p>One of the parlor windows, near by, was open,
but the shade was drawn well down, so that anybody
within the room could not be seen by a person<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
outside who might seek to look in. As he
turned in from the street, he had fancied he caught
the sound of voices drifting out through that window,
and one was, he believed, that of Janet.</p>

<p>Presently the maid came, and he asked for Miss
Harting. “I haven’t a card,” he said. “Please
tell her it is Mr. Locke, who would like to see her
a few minutes.”</p>

<p>He was left standing in the hall, which was
lighted by the soft glow of a shaded lamp. In a
brief time the maid returned.</p>

<p>“Miss Harting is engaged,” she said, “and cannot
see you.”</p>

<p>It seemed that his heart stopped beating, and
he stood quite still, unwilling to believe it could be
true. The maid opened the door. He passed out
with the step of a somnambulist.</p>

<p>So, after all, she was that sort of a girl! Only
the thoughtless and shallow render judgment without
a proper hearing and an investigation. He
had thought her something more than a girl easily
swayed and swept away by every light, shifting
wind; but it now seemed that he had invested her
with imaginary qualities and a character which
she did not possess.</p>

<p>The door closed behind him. His feet threatened
to drag as he walked toward the gate. Suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
he stiffened at the sound of a laugh heard
through the open window. His teeth clicked, his
hands clenched, and every nerve in his body
seemed to jerk taut as a bowstring. King was
there—laughing!</p>

<p>He had turned to face the window, and for a few
seconds he stood perfectly rigid and motionless.
He struck no pose, made no gesture; but he, too,
laughed, silently.</p>

<p>“Last time we met,” he breathed at length,
“you called me a liar, Benton King, and I held
myself. If you were to repeat that word to me
to-night, I’d knock you down in your tracks.”</p>

<p>His step was steady enough now as he walked
away. For a moment he thought of returning to
the hotel and writing her a letter, stating the truth
briefly; but he dismissed the idea almost immediately.</p>

<p>“She’ll find out in time,” he said; “for the
whole of Kingsbridge will know after the meeting
Thursday night. When she does find out, perhaps
she’ll be sorry for her mistake, but it will be too
late.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX<br>
<small>BANCROFT COMES TO CONQUER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Never before, even though it was the middle
of the week, had such a crowd of Bancroft
fans accompanied the team to a
neighboring town. When the train stopped they
began hopping off the cars, like fleas from the back
of a cat to which insect powder has been applied,
and in a few moments the station platform was
packed with them, laughing, joking, confident of
what the afternoon held in store.</p>

<p>In short order they swarmed into every restaurant
in town. Having satisfied their hunger, they
went forth into the streets of Kingsbridge to wait
for the hour of the game, some of them to seek
citizens who were willing to back the local team
with real money.</p>

<p>But Fancy Dyke and two associates, provided
with rolls of the “long green,” had struck Kingsbridge
by an earlier train and raked the place for
bets with a fine-tooth comb. Kingsbridgers who
had money they were willing to risk sought the
assurance of Henry Cope that Tom Locke would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
pitch; and, with this guarantee, they proceeded to
“take a chance.”</p>

<p>Before the gates opened that afternoon, more
money had been posted than ever before on a
single game in the Northern League. For, while
the milltown people had heard that the Bullies
would present a new left-handed slabman, the
promise that Locke would do the tossing for the
Kinks left them still with a feeling of assurance
undisturbed by the least uncertainty.</p>

<p>Not that they believed there was no chance of
losing, but their faith in Lefty was so great that
it seemed at least a five-to-one shot in Kingsbridge’s
favor; and a man who would “squeeze
his roll” with such an opportunity staring him in
the face certainly lacked sporting blood.</p>

<p>That afternoon, as the hour of the game drew
on, only the unyielding strictness of foremen and
bosses kept the mills running, the workmen almost
threatening to desert in a body. Some of
them slipped away, even though they knew they
were inviting discharge by doing so.</p>

<p>Naturally, the curiosity to see Bancroft’s new
pitcher was very great, and there was a mighty
craning of necks on the bleachers and in the stand
when the visitors appeared for practice.</p>

<p>The man whose name had been given as Craddock<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
was easily seen, being over six feet in height,
and having amazingly long arms and legs; in fact,
he seemed to be nearly all arms and legs. He was
not a handsome person, with a hatchet face and a
huge beak of a nose, while his ears stood out like
fans on either side of his long, narrow head. He
carried his shoulders hunched forward, and walked
with a queer bobbing movement of the knees, a
sort of buckling with each step. In more ways
than one his appearance was suggestive of a crane.</p>

<p>Craddock warmed up without letting himself
loose at all, giving the eager watchers no chance
to get an idea of his capability by anything in that
preliminary performance.</p>

<p>With the appearance of the home team, Hutchinson
sprang a surprise. A new man came on the
field with them, a bronzed, husky, rawboned man,
who quickly set the crowd to speculating as to his
identity. When the local pitchers began limbering
their wings, one question was quickly answered;
for when the stranger commenced to
warm up, also, it was seen that he was a pitcher;
and many a Kingsbridger hoped he would prove
to be better than either Deever or Skillings.</p>

<p>Mike Riley, smoking industriously, stood around
with his hands in his pockets, watching his players
in a self-satisfied manner. His bearing was more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
than encouraging for those who had journeyed
thirty miles to see the Bullies win. After a time,
he walked over and spoke to Hutchinson. They
talked earnestly for several minutes, Riley making
gestures with his clenched fist and nodding his
head savagely, while Hutch shrugged his shoulders
repeatedly.</p>

<p>When the Kingsbridge manager turned toward
the local bench, he found Henry Cope standing
near it.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the grocer, “what did old Riley
have t’ say? Tried ter browbeat ye, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Hutchinson, “he reasserted his claim
to Hazelton, and said we’d surely lose this game
out of the count if we persisted in pitching the
man. You can see, Cope, that it’s no bluff; the
meeting is called for to-morrow night. I’ve got
Ringling, a new pitcher, here, and he’s clever.
Don’t you think we’d better use him?”</p>

<p>“I notified you,” said the grocer irritably, “that
Locke would pitch this game, and he’ll pitch it.
Put him in.”</p>

<p>“All right,” growled Hutchinson, in exasperation,
“have your own way.” As he sat down on
the bench, he added to himself: “You pig-headed
old fool!”</p>

<p>So it was Locke who went on the slab when the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
umpire called “play,” and Bancroft promptly sent
Harney jogging forth to the pan with his pet bat
on his shoulder. Tom was given a rousing cheer
by his admirers.</p>

<p>“You know what to do to ’em, Lefty,” yelled a
man on the bleachers. “You’re the boy fer us.
We’re backin’ you.”</p>

<p>Harney drove his spikes into the dry ground and
squared himself, his bat held high and ready.
His posture was that of a man who welcomed
speed, and rather preferred that the ball should
be up around his shoulders; therefore, Locke
opened with one across his knees on the inside
corner. True, Harney hit it promptly, but he
only batted a weak grounder into the diamond,
and Labelle, grabbing it quickly, whipped him out
at first by a wide margin.</p>

<p>“Just as easy as ever!” whooped a delighted
Kingsbridger. “Pick off the next one, Tommy,
old top.”</p>

<p>Trollop held his bat low, so Locke kept the ball
high and close, causing it to jump, and the Bancroft
center fielder slashed at three without making
even a foul.</p>

<p>“Some pitchin’, Lefty, some pitchin’!” was the
cry.</p>

<p>Wop Grady, his face knotted and puckered, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
usual, slammed at the first one handed him, and
hoisted a high foul, which Oulds smothered close
to the wire netting that protected the people in
the stand; and Kingsbridge gave Locke a cheer
that resembled a cowboy yell more than anything
else.</p>

<p>Every eye seemed to be turned on Bancroft’s
new pitcher as he teetered awkwardly out upon
the diamond. The ball was thrown to him, and he
whipped three or four scorchers to Harney, at
first, before Labelle was ready to bat; but not
until he toed the slab to pitch to the batter did he
put his remarkable delivery on exhibition.</p>

<p>Suddenly he swung far backward, pivoting on
his left foot and shooting his right arm and right
leg into the air, while his left hand carried the
ball far, far over until it seemed that he was trying
to touch the ground with it. Up he came and
forward on to his right foot, his pitching hand
sweeping through the air to send the ball burning
across a corner of the pan.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Nom de tonnerre!</i>
” gasped Labelle, his eyes
bulging, his bat hanging poised.</p>

<p>“Strike!” cried the umpire.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XL">CHAPTER XL<br>
<small>PINWHEEL MURTEL</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The great Bancroft crowd laughed. They
had come to Kingsbridge to see their new
southpaw show the Kinks something about
pitching. Incidentally they had made arrangements
to take home with them various sums of
money which the foolish Kingsbridgers had wagered
on their team.</p>

<p>Bangs whipped the ball back, and Craddock
again went through with that remarkable delivery,
looking, as one man expressed it, “as though he
was all arms ’n’ legs.” Again the ball bit a corner
off the plate, and Labelle, fascinated by the
pitcher’s gyrations, swung too late.</p>

<p>The only delay was that caused by the movements
of Craddock preliminary to pitching, and he
did not waste a single “teaser” on the Kinks’ first
hitter. The third one was high, with a sharp slant
on it, and the little Canadian whiffed out.</p>

<p>“There’s pitchin’ fur ye!” yelled a Bancrofter.
“What d’ye think o’ <em>that</em>?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Nom de tonnerre!</i>
” said Labelle again, as he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
retired to the bench. “Where he come from, de
circus?”</p>

<p>Stark, following, fouled three times, but eventually
the Bancrofter twirler outguessed him, and
sent him, fanned, to take his place beside Labelle.</p>

<p>“Whut’s he got?” asked Reddy Crandall, pawing
among the bats.</p>

<p>“Curves and speed,” answered Larry, in a low
tone. “Don’t get to watching his delivery and
forget to watch the ball. Go to him! He can be
hit.”</p>

<p>But Reddy could not hit him that time, and the
Bancroft crowd howled as their new projector
fanned the third man in succession. There were
some who began to prophesy that the Kinks would
be shut out without a hit on their own field. There
are always wise heads who make foolish prophecies
early in every game.</p>

<p>The second inning opened with Bancroft’s left-handed
hitters coming up, and Locke, knowing
they had been practicing against a left-handed
pitcher, worked with the utmost care and judgment,
his change of speed being most effective, as
it caused two of the four men who faced him to
bump weak grounders into the diamond, to their
complete undoing.</p>

<p>With two down, Bernsteine, standing well back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
from the plate, with a long bat grasped near the
end, stepped into a “roundhouse,” and lined out a
pretty single. It did no good, however, for Lisotte
banged a grasser into the clinging paws of
Labelle, and Bernsteine was out at second on a
force.</p>

<p>“You all hit him, boys,” cried a Bancroft man.
“You’ll straighten ’em out by and by, and lose the
balls over in the slashings at the foot of Bald
Mountain. He’s due to get his bumps.”</p>

<p>Craddock continued his remarkable work, and,
one after the other, Anastace, Hinkey, and Lace
were mowed down, even as their comrades had
fallen in the first round.</p>

<p>The Bullies were urged to fall on Locke, and
Bangs led off with a long drive to center, which
Sockamore retrieved on the fly. Craddock did
not seem to be strong with the club, and he made a
laughable exhibition by seeking to hit the low ones
on the inside corner, where Locke kept the ball
for a strike-out. Harney got one to his fancy,
through a momentary lapse on the part of Locke,
but, by tall hustling out in the left garden, Reddy
Crandall picked the globule out of the air.</p>

<p>“You’re hittin’ him now,” declared the encouraging
Bancroft fan. “Keep it up; they can’t get
’em all. You’ll put the blanket on him yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span></p>

<p>The delight of the visitors may be imagined as
Craddock finished Kingsbridge’s list by handing
the last three men upon it the same medicine he
had given the first six. Three innings had passed,
nine men had faced him, and not one of them had
even hit the ball into the diamond. It began to
seem that the man who had prophesied no hits
and no runs for the Kinks might not be such a
fool, after all.</p>

<p>Locke’s manner was almost trancelike as he
toed the slab at the beginning of the fourth. His
first ball was wide, but Trollop caught the second
one on the seam and pounded it for two sacks,
bringing the Bancroft rooters up, roaring. They
continued to roar, as Grady bunted and sacrificed
Trollop to third, where, with only one out, he was
in position to score on the squeeze play if the Bullies
saw fit to try it.</p>

<p>They did try it, but, knowing what was coming,
Locke pitched to Mace high and close, and Mace
bumped a little pop fly straight into Lefty’s hands.
Holding the ball a moment, Locke smiled at Trollop,
who made ludicrous efforts to stop and turn
back toward third. The roaring of the Bancrofters
died away in a disappointed groan as they saw
the ball tossed to Fred Lace for the third put-out.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is something of a game!” crowed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
Stark, capering toward the bench. “It’s about
time we came to life and touched that gangling
port-sider up a few. Stop watching his contortions,
Labelle. This is no vaudeville performance;
you’re here to play baseball. Try to hit
him, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“You bet!” growled the Canadian. “I hit de
ball dis time; you watch.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, although he slashed viciously, he
did not graze the first one.</p>

<p>Suddenly Reddy Crandall, who had spent his
time on the bench staring at the long-geared
pitcher, struck his thigh a resounding slap.</p>

<p>“I’ve got him!” he declared excitedly. “I’ve
spotted that guy! I know him now! Craddock,
hey? No wonder them Bancrofters come up to
this town to-day loaded with bettin’ money.
Craddock! Why, that’s ‘Pinwheel’ Murtel, of
the National League, as good a man as Matty
himself, only he’s got a rotten disposition, an’ no
manager can handle him. He’s been blacklisted
and outlawed time after time, but he’s such a wonder
they always fix it up somehow, an’ take him
back when he wants to come. That’s Murtel, I’ll
bet my life on it. Fellers, we’ll never score to-day
with <em>him</em> pitchin’.”</p>

<p>Stark, standing near, had ceased to swing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
two bats he had picked up, listening to the excited
words of Crandall. He had never seen the famous
and eccentric Pinwheel Murtel, but he had
heard a great deal about the man, as, doubtless,
had every other baseball player in the country.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” he muttered, having turned to stare
at the lengthy twirler. “I believe you’re right,
Reddy.”</p>

<p>“I <em>know</em> I’m right,” said Crandall. “I’ve
been trying to figure out who the man was, and
I’ve got him at last. At his best, he can walk any
three of us without a man down and then keep us
from scoring. This game is as good as settled,
and a lot of Kingsbridge sports have lost some
good money to-day.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Crandall!” said Locke swiftly.
“Even if the man <em>is</em> Pinwheel Murtel, he isn’t invincible.”</p>

<p>“There goes Pete ag’in,” said Reddy, as Labelle
fanned out the second time. “Nobody’s
even touched him.”</p>

<p>“What of it? The best pitchers in the business
can be hit.”</p>

<p>“But not by batters in our class.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sometimes they can be hit by batters in
our class. Mathewson has been batted and beaten
by a scrub country team, at least once, according<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
to his own confession; and other top-notch pitchers
have met the same treatment, much to their
surprise.</p>

<p>“We’re going to fight this game through to the
last ditch, I hope, whether that man is Murtel or
not. There’s no knowing what may happen. At
any rate, if I can hold them down, and you fellows
keep on giving me the support you have, they
may not get any runs. We’re not going to quit,
are we, just because we’ve found out that Craddock
is Murtel?”</p>

<p>“No,” rasped Jim Sockamore, the Indian, “we
won’t quit! You’re right, Lefty; mebbe well
beat that bunch yet, if we support you.”</p>

<p>It was plain, however, that Crandall’s discovery
had taken the courage out of him, and it seemed
to fade away entirely as Stark, also, fanned.
Reddy stood up to the plate with his heart in his
shoes and swung apathetically, being sliced down
without waste of energy on the part of the pitcher.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLI">CHAPTER XLI<br>
<small>GONE WRONG</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Locke muttered a single word of disgust
as he rose from the bench and walked toward
the pitcher’s slab. On the way he
stopped suddenly, staring for an instant toward
some teams and automobiles down beyond the far
end of the third-base bleachers. Then he walked
onward, but some of the flush was gone from his
face.</p>

<p>Hutchinson, sitting silent on the bench, had done
little toward directing his players. Should the
game go against Kingsbridge, as he believed it
would, he was prepared to answer criticism by
saying that Henry Cope’s interference had made
it impossible for him to rely on his own judgment
and generalship.</p>

<p>Long before Crandall named the Bancroft
pitcher, Hutch was wise to the man. He had likewise
observed that Locke did not seem as efficient
as usual, although good support had prevented
the Bullies from hammering out runs.</p>

<p>“When the break comes,” thought the rascally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
manager, “it’s dollars to doughnuts they’ll get
his goat for fair.”</p>

<p>The Kingsbridge pitcher looked ill as he found
the slab at the beginning of the fifth; his face was
pale and set, and there was something like a glare
in his eyes. He seemed to be in haste to hand
Pat McGovern a pass, pitching one ball after another
without pausing to steady down, though both
Oulds and Stark begged him to take more time;
and not one of the four he threw for Pat even
grazed a corner.</p>

<p>Following this, he bored Bernsteine in the ribs,
and two men were on the sacks, with no one down.
Remembering the first game Locke had pitched on
that field, the Kingsbridge crowd declined to be
frightened.</p>

<p>“He’ll steady down in a moment,” they said.
“Just watch him.”</p>

<p>But in a moment McGovern and Bernsteine each
moved up a sack on a weirdly wild pitch to Lisotte.</p>

<p>Hutchinson turned quickly to Ringling.</p>

<p>“Shake the kinks out of your arm, Ring,” he
directed. “Hurry up about it.”</p>

<p>Oulds had called Locke, meeting him a few steps
in front of the pan.</p>

<p>“What’s biting you now, son?” he growled,
heedless of the howling Bancrofters, who were demanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
that the umpire should keep the game
going. “You’ve got the wabbles; I don’t believe
you can see the rubber.”</p>

<p>He wondered at the look in Tom’s eyes. Locke
moistened his dry lips.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, Oulds,” he said huskily; “I’m all
right now.”</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t look it,” retorted Hunchy.
“Be you havin’ a fit, or what? You’ve got to stop
heavin’ the ball as fast as you can git holt of it.
Take your time, now. Don’t let Lisotte bunt;
prob’ly he’ll try it. If they start scorin’, they’re
li’ble to win the game right here.”</p>

<p>“I tell you I’m all right now,” declared Locke
savagely. “Give me the ball.”</p>

<p>“He’s havin’ a reg’ler fit,” muttered the
catcher, surrendering the sphere and backing toward
his position behind the pan.</p>

<p>Lisotte squared himself again; the coachers
talked excitedly, the Bancroft crowd rooted for
runs; Kingsbridge was silent. Bernsteine took a
long lead off second, and McGovern danced back
and forth at third. Locke was taking time at last,
apparently trying hard to throw off the feverish
wildness that had put him into “a hole.”</p>

<p>Swift, high, and close came the ball to Lisotte,
difficult indeed to bunt safely. But the little Canuck<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
did not try to bunt; instead, as if he knew
just what was due, he met the sphere with a
snappy swing, driving it humming into the field
between center and right.</p>

<p>McGovern danced gayly to the scoring station,
Bernsteine following with a rush. There was a
wild riot on the Bancroft bleachers, men leaping
up and down, flinging their hats into the air
and yelling themselves purple in the face; for,
with two runs scored, no one out, Locke apparently
all to the bad, and Pinwheel Murtel in Big League
form, it seemed that the game had been clinched
for the Bullies.</p>

<p>Since coming on the field, Tom Locke had been
looking for Janet Harting; somehow he was confident
she would attend this game. It is likely
that thoughts of her had disturbed him and prevented
him from concentrating upon the work of
pitching, although he had not been aware of it.</p>

<p>Walking out to take his position at the beginning
of the fifth, however, his searching eyes discovered
her blue parasol, and, beneath it, Janet,
sitting at the side of Benton King in the same carriage
in which he had first beheld her. As Locke
looked, King seemed to be returning his gaze.
The pitcher saw Bent lean toward the girl and say
something, whereupon both laughed. For the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
time being Tom lost his head, greatly to the advantage
of the rejoicing Bancrofters.</p>

<p>He knew it; no one on that field knew it better.
And nothing could have served better to sober him
and bring him to his senses than that wicked,
timely line drive by Lisotte. He saw Ringling
warming up and Hutchinson talking to Henry
Cope, who plainly was not feeling right. Of
course, the manager was asking permission—or
demanding it—to remove him immediately from
the game.</p>

<p>“I’m a fool!” thought Tom. “I have played
right into that rascal’s hand.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLII">CHAPTER XLII<br>
<small>A SUDDEN SHIFT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">He hoped Cope would not yield. Perhaps
the damage was done already, but he
would try to redeem himself if they did
not bench him.</p>

<p>Hutchinson was saying:</p>

<p>“What’s the use to keep him in, man alive?
He’s lost the game already.”</p>

<p>“If he’s lost the game,” returned the obstinate
grocer, “what’s the use to take him out? I don’t
see no sense in that. Let him pitch some more.
He braced up t’other time; mebbe he will
ag’in.”</p>

<p>Speechless with exasperation, Hutchinson
turned back and reseated himself on the bench.
Seeing this, and understanding that Locke would
continue yet a while on the firing line, Stark ran
to him, grasped him with both hands, and spoke in
swift, yet steady, tones:</p>

<p>“Pull yourself together, Lefty; you’ve got to
do it, and you can. Bangs is easy, and that man
Murtel can’t hit a balloon. Put the ball over, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
take chances with them; we’re behind you. Don’t
hurry, and keep your head.”</p>

<p>Tom gave the disturbed captain a reassuring
smile.</p>

<p>“I know I ought to be sent to the stable,” he
said; “but I’ll do my level best now. Watch me.”</p>

<p>Bingo Bangs was not much of a hitter, and the
crowd saw Lefty whip the ball through a single
groove three times in succession, and three times
the Bullies’ catcher hammered the air. After
the third strike, the ball having been returned
by Oulds, Locke caught a quick signal from the
backstop, and wheeled, to flash the sphere like a
shot into the hands of Labelle, who had dodged
past the runner.</p>

<p>Labelle nailed Lisotte, and the two Canadians
exchanged courtesies in choice patois. This second
swift putout awoke some of the saddened
Kingsbridgers, their sudden yells of satisfaction
mingling with the groans of the Bancrofters.</p>

<p>“<em>Now</em> we’re all right!” cried Larry Stark.
“Take a fall out of old Pinwheel, Lefty. We’ll
make a game of this yet.”</p>

<p>Locke’s nerves were growing steadier. He had
forced himself to dismiss every thought of the
girl who had treated him so shabbily, and the man,
her companion, who had flung him an insult and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
escaped a thrashing. Until the last inning was
over he would concentrate his energies upon the
work in hand.</p>

<p>As before, the Bancroft pitcher’s efforts to connect
with Locke’s slants were laughable; he could
not touch the ball, even to foul it.</p>

<p>“Hold them down now, Craddock,” begged
Fancy Dyke from the bleachers. “They shut us
out last time we was here; let’s return the compliment
to-day.”</p>

<p>Murtel grinned; thus far he had seen nothing
that would lead him to doubt his ability to hold the
Kinks runless. Nor was he ruffled when Anastace
got a scratch hit from him in the last of the
fifth; for the three following batters were like
putty in his hands.</p>

<p>On the part of Kingsbridge there was uncertainty
and anxiety as Locke returned to the slab,
for now the head of Bancroft’s list, the best hitters
of the team, were coming up to face him, and
they were full of confidence. There were times,
it seemed, when Lefty was sadly erratic, and were
he to slump again in this game the faith of his admirers
would be much impaired.</p>

<p>Never had Tom Locke put more brains into his
pitching. He had a speed ball that smoked, and
his curves broke as sharply keen as a razor’s edge;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
furthermore, he “mixed them up” cleverly, his
change of pace proving most baffling, and his slow
ball always seeming to come loafing over just when
the hitter was looking for a whistler.</p>

<p>Harney snarled his annoyance after fanning;
Trollop almost broke his back bumping one of the
slow ones into the clutches of Labelle; Grady lifted
a miserable foul back of first for Hinkey to gobble.</p>

<p>Hutchinson had temporarily deserted the bench,
and the Kinks came trotting in. Observing this,
Locke grabbed Stark, and whispered something in
his ear, Larry listening and nodding.</p>

<p>“It won’t hurt to try it,” said the captain.
“Here, Oulds.”</p>

<p>It was the catcher’s turn to lead off. He listened
to Stark’s repetition of Locke’s suggestion;
then he stepped out to the plate, slipped his hands
up on the bat a bit as Murtel pitched, and bunted
the first ball.</p>

<p>The Bullies were taken by surprise. The ball
rolled slowly down just inside the third-base line,
and Oulds, leaping away like a streak, actually
turned that bunt into a safe base hit, to the complaints
of the Bancroft spectators and the whooping
merriment of the Kingsbridgers.</p>

<p>Locke was promptly in position, and he followed
with a bunt toward first. Even as the bunt was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
made the bat seemed to fall from his hands, and
he was off like a shot toward the initial sack, leaping
over the rolling ball as he went. Only by the
liveliest kind of hustling did Murtel get the sphere
up and snap it humming past the runner in time
to get an assist on Harney’s put-out.</p>

<p>Oulds was on second. Labelle, grinning,
hopped into the batter’s box, and astonished the
spectators of the game, and the Bancroft players,
as well, by contributing the third bunt, which was
so wholly unexpected that he reached first by a
narrow margin. And now the Kingsbridge crowd
was making all the noise, the Bancrofters seeming
stricken dumb with apprehension.</p>

<p>Murtel was angry, a fact he could not hide.
For the first time he seemed, with deliberate intent,
to keep the first ball pitched beyond the reach
of the batter. Oulds, of course, had anchored
temporarily at third, and Labelle, taking a chance,
tried to steal on that pitch.</p>

<p>Bangs made a line throw, but Lisotte, seeing
Oulds dash off third, cut it down, only to discover
that the tricky Kingsbridge catcher had bluffed.
The Frenchman failed in an attempt to pin the
runner before he could dive back to the sack.</p>

<p>Locke had taken Crandall’s place on the coaching
line back of third, giving Reddy a chance to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
get his bat, as he was the hitter who followed
Stark; and it was the play to keep the ball rolling
as fast as possible. Tom was laughing and full
of ginger, his words of instruction to the runners
sometimes sounding clear above the uproar of the
excited crowd.</p>

<p>“Keep it up! Keep it up!” he called. “Get
off those cushions! Take a lead, and score!
<em>Look out!</em>” Murtel had made an attempt to
catch Labelle by a quick throw, but the little Canadian
slid under McGovern’s arm.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLIII">CHAPTER XLIII<br>
<small>A GAME WORTH WINNING</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Locke had forgotten the blue parasol and
its owner; he had no fleeting thought for
Benton King; he was heart and soul in the
game.</p>

<p>With one out, it seemed an excellent time for
Kingsbridge to keep up the bunting, and attempt
to score on it by the “squeeze,” so Bancroft’s infield
drew closer and the outfielders quickly came
in.</p>

<p>At the plate, Stark gave a secret signal, changing
the style of play, and then he set the local
crowd frantic by meeting Murtel’s high one on the
trade mark. With the outfielders playing in their
usual places, that line drive would have been good
for a clean single, but while they were chasing it
down, Larry dug all the way round to third, Oulds
and Labelle romping over the rubber with the runs
that tied the score.</p>

<p>The whole Kingsbridge team was laughing, now,
while Murtel, enraged over being outguessed and
deceived, was almost frenzied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span></p>

<p>“It’s a great top piece you have, Lefty, old
pal,” cried Larry Stark. “That was the trick to
get ’em going. Look at Pinwheel champ the bit.”</p>

<p>But Hutchinson was back on the bench now, and
he directed Crandall to hit the ball out. Reddy,
trying to respond manfully, boosted an infield fly,
and Stark was forced to remain on the sack while
it was caught. Had Anastace, coming next, taken
a daring chance and bunted, it is possible that the
Bullies might have been thrown into confusion
again; but he had orders from Hutchinson to hit,
and in trying to do so he succumbed to Murtel’s
strategy, expiring in the box.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is some game, believe me!” shouted a
Kingsbridger. “Hold ’em where they are, Lefty.
You’ve got the stuff to do it. We depend on
you.”</p>

<p>The Bancrofters who had wagered money on the
tussle were not as cocksure as they had been, and
doubtless more than one, Manager Riley included,
regretted that matters had not been privately arranged
in advance so that it would not be necessary
to rely almost wholly on the prowess their
new left-handed pitcher.</p>

<p>Surely their regrets became still more acute
when, in the seventh, Locke showed no let-up in
form, and was not even ruffled when McGovern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
reached first on an infield error, the other three
batters to face him going the way of all flesh.</p>

<p>“Oh, you Lefty!” was once more the rejoicing
cry of the palpitating Kingsbridgers.</p>

<p>Murtel came back with a shut-out, although
Hinkey led off with a scratch hit.</p>

<p>“Hold ’em, Lefty—hold ’em!” was the beseeching
cry.</p>

<p>Bangs and Murtel faded like morning dew before
a burning sun, but Harney got into a speedy
one and banged it for two hassocks, setting the
shaking Bancrofters off again in a tremendous
uproar. Nevertheless, the lucky batter remained
at second, where Stark and Labelle kept him
dancing back and forth while Locke took Trollop’s
measure and put him away until the next game
should be played.</p>

<p>With no one batting ahead of him, Locke advanced
to the pan in the last of the eighth without
instructions. The first ball was too close, but the
second came slanting over, and he bunted. Again
it was the unexpected, and never had a prettier
bunt been pulled off. Nevertheless, it was only
Tom’s wonderful knack of starting at high speed
with the first jump and covering the ground like a
streak that enabled him to reach the sack a gasping
breath ahead of the ball.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span></p>

<p>“Safe!” cried the umpire.</p>

<p>The Bullies started to kick, nearly every man on
the team taking part in it. The crowd hooted and
hissed, but it was only the nerve of the umpire in
pulling his watch which finally sent the Bancroft
players, growling, back to their positions. There
was so much money wagered on the game that they
could not afford to lose it through forfeiture; but
henceforth they badgered the umpire on almost
every decision, even scoffing when he declared in
their favor.</p>

<p>Labelle sacrificed Locke to second. Stark,
thirsting for a hit, hoisted a fly to center. Then,
just as the visitors were breathing easier, Crandall
smashed a drive into right field.</p>

<p>Locke was on the way to third even before bat
and ball met. Sockamore, coaching, seeing Tom
coming like the wind, took a desperate chance, and,
with a furious flourish of his arms, signaled for
him to keep on. Out in right field Mace got the
sphere and poised himself for a throw to the pan.</p>

<p>There was a choking hush. Staring, breathless,
suffering with suspense, the watchers waited.</p>

<p>“Slide!” yelled Sockamore, with a shriek like
the blast of a locomotive whistle.</p>

<p><a href="#i_frontis">Spikes first, Locke slid.</a> The whistling ball
spanked into Bangs’ clutches and he lunged to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
make the tag. But Tom’s feet had slipped across
the rubber, and the downward motion of the umpire’s
open, outspread hand declared him safe.</p>

<p>Again the Bullies protested, and again the umpire
was compelled to produce his watch. With
difficulty the excited crowd was kept off the field.</p>

<p>Laughing, Stark had helped Locke to rise, and
made a show of brushing some of the dust from
him.</p>

<p>“It’s your game that wins to-day, if you can
hold them down now,” declared Larry. “It was
bunting when they weren’t expecting it that did
the trick. Oh, say, there’ll be some sore heads in
Bancroft to-night!”</p>

<p>Henry Cope came bursting out of the crowd
back of the bench to shake hands with Locke.</p>

<p>“Sufferin’ Moses, whut a game!” he exclaimed.
“If I ain’t under the doctor’s care ter-morrer
it’ll be queer. Keep ’em right where they be, an’
we’ve won.”</p>

<p>“Lots of good that will do us when the game is
counted out of the series,” sneered Hutchinson.</p>

<p>“Even if they count it out,” returned the
grocer, “folks round this town’re goin’ to have a
heap o’ Bancroft’s money t’ spend.”</p>

<p>Reddy Crandall did not score. He had done<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
his part well, and he uttered no complaint when
Anastace failed to hit.</p>

<p>The Bullies had not given up. Savage, sarcastic,
insolent, they fought it out in the first of
the ninth, bearing themselves, until the last man
was down, as if they still believed they would win.
Locke, however, had them at his mercy, refusing
to prolong the agony by letting a hitter reach first.</p>

<p>With some difficulty he fought off the delighted
Kingsbridgers who swarmed, cheering, around
him, and would have lifted him to their shoulders.
When he finally managed to break clear of the
throng he thought suddenly of Janet, and looked
round for her.</p>

<p>Benton King was driving toward the gate by
which teams and autos were admitted to the field.
She had lowered her parasol, and, before disappearing
through the gate, she turned to gaze backward,
as if looking for some one in the midst of
the still-cheering crowd that covered the diamond.</p>

<small>FACING HIS ACCUSERS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Seasonable July weather caused discomfort
for the seven persons assembled in the
dingy office of Rufus Kilgore for the purpose
of attending the meeting called to consider
Manager Mike Riley’s claims. Riley himself, in
his shirt sleeves, sat with his back toward one of
the wide-open windows, a handkerchief tucked
round his neck inside his collar, grumbling and
smoking. Anson Graham, president of the
league, a serious, middle-aged man, with block-trimmed
whiskers, who had the look of one who
might be just, but would rarely temper his justice
with mercy, was talking to Kilgore, the secretary
of the organization, who occupied the chair at the
desk.</p>

<p>David Farman and William Jones, representing
Fryeburg and Lakeport, respectively, were aimlessly
discussing various topics, such as the
weather, crop prospects, and the ardent desire
that the usual number of boarders from the city
might be netted by the blandishments of advertisements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
which pictured the part of the country
in which they were interested as a summer Eden.
Benton King, appearing restless, talked in low
tones to the ever-icy Bob Hutchinson.</p>

<p>“Confound it!” growled Riley, looking at his
watch. “Where’s Hen Cope ’n’ that man Hazelton?
It’s one minute of time fur the meetin’ to
begin, ’n’ they oughter be here.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they won’t come,” said the lawyer.
“Cope is a mule, and he may try to block proceedings
by staying away.”</p>

<p>“But he can’t do that,” rasped Mike. “We
can go ahead without him. It’s time. Hadn’t
you better call the meetin’ to order, Mr. Graham?”</p>

<p>At this moment, footsteps were heard on the
stairs, and the door opened, to admit the puffing
Kingsbridge grocer, who paused to remove his
hat, mop his shining, moist dome, and look the assemblage
over.</p>

<p>“Good evenin’, ever’body,” he said pleasantly.
“On time, ain’t I?”</p>

<p>“Just about, an’ that’s all,” answered Riley.
“Where’s th’ slip’ry guy that’s caused all this
trouble?”</p>

<p>“You mean Locke? Ain’t he here?”</p>

<p>“I mean Hazelton, ’n’ he ain’t here.”</p>

<p>“That’s strange,” said Cope, plainly a trifle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
disturbed. “He lef’ Kingsbridge on the early
train this mornin’, sayin’ that he’d meet me here
to-night. I thought sure I’d find him waitin’.”</p>

<p>“Left town, hey?” cried Riley. “Left town
this mornin’! Well, I swear! So help me, he’s
skipped!”</p>

<p>He was not the only one through whose head
had passed the same thought, but Henry Cope immediately
raised an agitated protest against such
an idea, asserting his belief that the absent man
would put in an appearance. They were induced
to wait a while, although it was likely that Cope
was the only one who was not satisfied that time
was being wasted. In his heart, even the grocer
began to doubt.</p>

<p>As the minutes ticked away, Cope looked
anxious, Riley smoked and growled, Hutchinson
remained cool, and Benton King fidgeted. Finally
Anson Graham said:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, it is now ten minutes past the time
set for this meeting to be called, and I think we
had better proceed without further delay; for it
seems that the party accused does not intend to
appear in his own defense. If you will please
come to order, the secretary will read the protest
of Manager Riley which led to—”</p>

<p>Breathless and anxious, Henry Cope had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
listening to the sound of hurried footsteps on the
stairs, and now, as the door was thrust open and
the tardy one stepped in, he gave an exclamation
of great relief and satisfaction.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, gentlemen,” said Tom
Locke, his face flushed. “I believe I am somewhat
late, but it was the fault of my watch, which
I have discovered is slow. I hope I have not kept
you waiting long.”</p>

<p>He bowed to everybody in a general, pleasant
way, smiling on Cope, who had sprung forward to
grip his hand.</p>

<p>“I knowed you’d come,” said the grocer. “I
told them you’d be here. Now, gents, you can go
ahead.”</p>

<p>A hard gleam had appeared in the eyes of Tom
Locke as he noted the presence of Benton King,
but, after the first swift glance, he ignored the
lumberman’s son.</p>

<p>The meeting was called to order in the regular
manner, and Kilgore read the written protest of
Manager Riley, which, as it appeared, had privately
been formally worded by the lawyer himself.
The document curtly charged that “the
baseball player passing under the name of Tom
Locke and appearing as a member of the Kingsbridge
team of the Northern League” was in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
reality Paul Hazelton, of Princeton, and made the
claim that, because of “unterminated negotiations,”
Riley held an indisputable right to the
man’s services. Locke’s face wore a half-mocking
smile as he listened to the reading.</p>

<p>“You have heard the charge, sir,” said Anson
Graham, turning to Tom. “What answer have
you to make?”</p>

<p>This was the moment Cope had dreaded, but his
pitcher had given assurance that he would be
ready to meet every charge, and he waited now,
his lips parted, for the young man to answer.
His surprise, however, amounted to something
bordering on consternation when Locke quietly replied:</p>

<p>“It seems to me, Mr. President, that the first
duty of the man who makes this charge is to establish
that I am the party referred to in the document.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted Riley, without regard for the
regular order of procedure. “’Twon’t do ye no
good to deny it. We’ve got the proof.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Riley,” said Graham reprovingly;
“I am questioning the young man. Do you deny,
sir, that you are Paul Hazelton, of Princeton?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” was the prompt, clear answer, “I
deny it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span></p>

<p>Henry Cope nearly fell off his chair. In great
agitation, he reached out, grasped the speaker’s
coat, tugged at it, and whispered:</p>

<p>“Boy, boy, be keerful! It’s too late for that to
do any good.”</p>

<p>The dismay of the grocer was apparent to all,
and provoked some smiles; but the unruffled young
man simply turned and spoke to him in a low, calm
tone:</p>

<p>“Leave this to me, Mr. Cope, please.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” said the president, maintaining
an impartial manner, “it will be necessary for
Manager Riley to produce satisfactory evidence
that you <em>are</em> Paul Hazelton. Mr. Riley, your evidence.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got it,” asserted Mike positively. “Mr.
King can show somethin’ that’ll settle the matter
in short order.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLV">CHAPTER XLV<br>
<small>THE FORGERY</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Benton King, called upon, rose and expressed
regret that circumstances had involved
him in the unfortunate affair. He
spoke hurriedly, without looking at Locke, although
he was well aware that Tom’s eyes were
fixed upon him all the while.</p>

<p>At the first sight of Kingsbridge’s left-handed
pitcher, he stated, he had been struck by the
thought that he had seen the man somewhere before,
and, after racking his brain, he suddenly recalled
that it was at a game played the previous
year, between Princeton and Harvard, when
Locke, to use the name he had given in Kingsbridge,
had sat in uniform upon the Princeton
bench.</p>

<p>He went on to explain, with an effort to hide any
personal animosity in the matter, that the man’s
denial that he was Hazelton had led him to communicate
with a friend in New York, requesting
this friend to go to Princeton for the purpose of
obtaining the photograph of the college pitcher.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
This the friend had done, getting the picture from
the photographer who was generally patronized
by the undergraduates. Concluding, King produced
the photograph and the letter that had accompanied
it in the same mail, and placed them in
evidence.</p>

<p>Locke listened and watched, without making a
movement, a scornful smile on his lips. He
heard the letter read by King, and saw it turned
over, with the picture, to Anson Graham. The
president glanced at the letter, then seemed to
make a comparison of the photographed features
and those of the young man standing so enigmatically
cool beside the chair of Henry Cope.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Graham, extending the picture, “do
you deny that this is your likeness?”</p>

<p>Locke barely glanced at it.</p>

<p>“It is my picture,” he acknowledged.</p>

<p>“And that,” exulted Mike Riley, “<em>does</em> settle
it! He’s Hazelton, and here’s a letter from him,
dated December twenty-seven, last year, answering
a letter o’ mine, in which I offered him twenty-five
a week and board to pitch fer Bancroft this
season, a-sayin’ he wanted forty ’n’ board. Take
notice that he don’t say he won’t play for twenty-five,
but that it’s jest a clever try to boost me t’
forty. I base my claim on that letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span></p>

<p>“I cal’late this smooth guy, who’s had the nerve
to stan’ up here an’ practically swear that he
ain’t Paul Hazelton, used my offer to boost his
value with Mr. Cope, who, I hear, is payin’ him
outer all reason. Sneaky, underhand work, I call
it. Such a man is dang’r’us, an’ I hope that he
will be put on the blacklist so that he won’t be
able to play on any team in the league. That’s
the way to fix him.”</p>

<p>“I would like,” said Locke, “the privilege of
examining that letter.”</p>

<p>“Let him see it arter the rest have seen it,” said
Riley. “’Twon’t do him no good t’ destroy it.”</p>

<p>“I have no desire to destroy it,” declared Tom,
when the letter presently reached his hands and
he had glanced it over. “On the contrary, I have
a most powerful desire to preserve it carefully;
for it is a miserable forgery, and it would give me
no little satisfaction to see the scoundrels responsible
for its production properly prosecuted for a
criminal offense.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” snarled Riley. “More of his bluffin’.
He must think we’re fools t’ let him put over anything
like that on us. He’s trapped, an’ he can’t
wiggle outer it. Mr. President, I urge immediate
action on my protest, and I hope the directors of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
the league will put Mr. Paul Hazelton on the blacklist.”</p>

<p>Again Henry Cope tugged at Locke’s coat
skirts; he looked pitifully downcast and disheartened.</p>

<p>“You tole me,” he whispered dolefully, “that
you had it on ’em somehow, but it seems t’ me that
they’ve got it on you.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, Mr. Cope,” was the cool reply;
“this meeting is not over, and there is something
mighty interesting yet to come.” He turned to
the others. “Mr. President, I have some witnesses,
waiting outside at my request, whom I ask
leave to introduce. I will call them.”</p>

<p>Stepping swiftly to one of the open windows, he
thrust his head out and called. Directly footsteps
were again heard on the stairs. The door
was flung open to admit Sam Bryant, the bell boy
of the Central Hotel at Kingsbridge, followed by
a stranger, who did not seem more than twenty
years of age. The entrance of the boy appeared,
for once, at least, to jostle Bob Hutchinson out of
his usual unemotional calm, and the manager
glared at Sam, alarm and menace in his unpleasant
eyes.</p>

<p>“I have asserted that this letter,” said Locke,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
holding up the missive in question, “is a forgery.
It is a rather clever imitation of my handwriting,
a specimen of which was taken from my desk in
my room last Sunday, together with a letter which
the pilferer dared not present as evidence at this
meeting.</p>

<p>“I have reasons to believe that a party present
in this room was guilty of rifling that desk. It
happens that I did a slight favor for the younger
brother of this lad here, who is a bell boy at the
Central, and Sammy’s conscience has been troubling
him during the past few days, finally leading
him into a confession which interested me not a
little. Go ahead, Sammy, and tell what you have
to tell.”</p>

<p>In less than a minute, the icy Mr. Hutchinson,
warmed to the melting point, was on his feet denouncing
Sammy Bryant as a wicked little fabricator;
for the lad had told of being bribed by
Hutchinson to slip the pass-key of Locke’s room
from the office rack and unlock the door while
Tom was absent at church, and had averred that,
watching, he had seen Hutchinson sneak into the
room.</p>

<p>“I’ll make you smart for this, you young rascal!”
declared Hutch savagely. “You’ll lose your
job, anyhow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<p>“Mebbe,” returned the boy; “but you’ll lose
<em>yourn</em>.”</p>

<p>“What’s this mess got t’ do with Hazelton’s letter
ter me?” demanded Riley, essaying a diversion.
“If it was true, which I don’t b’lieve at all,
’twouldn’t have nothin’ t’ do with the genuineness
of that letter from Paul Hazelton.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Locke, something almost like pity
in his contemptuous smile, “to illustrate what pitiful
bunglers you and Hutchinson are, Riley, let
me tell you that in making an imitation of my
handwriting and attaching the supposed signature
of Paul Hazelton, you have mired yourselves in a
pit of your own digging. For, as I am not Paul
Hazelton, a letter written in imitation of my penmanship
and signed with his name <em>must</em> be a forgery.
It is my turn now to put the work of a
photographer in evidence.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLVI">CHAPTER XLVI<br>
<small>CLEARED UP</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The youthful stranger handed over a large,
square, flat package, and Locke quickly removed
the wrapper, displaying a group
photograph of a team of youthful baseball players,
upon the breasts of whose shirts could be seen
the word “Princeton.”</p>

<p>“This,” said Tom, displaying the picture,
“shows the Princeton College nine of this season,
with the name of every player printed at the bottom.
Here you may see the name of Hazelton,
followed by the letter P, and I would like to have
you look at it well; look at it, and see if you would
call it my picture. Also look over the rest of the
faces to see if you can find mine among them.”</p>

<p>Shaking with excitement, his eyes bulging with
wonder, Henry Cope was standing on his toes to
peer at the picture over Locke’s shoulder. Anson
Graham was looking at it, too; and, with the
exception of Hutchinson and King, the others
flocked round to get a peep.</p>

<p>“Great sassafras!” spluttered Cope. “I writ<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
a letter, makin’ Paul Hazelton an offer to pitch
for Kingsbridge, and <em>you</em> come in answer to that
letter. You likewise sent me a message—”</p>

<p>“Saying: ‘Coming, P. Hazelton,’” interrupted
Locke. “Of course, it never occurred to
you that there might be two Hazeltons. I have
never denied that my name is Hazelton, but I have
denied repeatedly that it is Paul Hazelton. It is
Philip. Four years ago I pitched a few games
for the Princeton varsity in my junior year, but
was obliged to give it up because of the opposition
of my father, a clergyman, who, having had a
friend killed in the game, has a perfect horror of
it.</p>

<p>“My younger brother, Paul, having caught the
fever, has incurred the displeasure of our strait-laced
father to the extent of being refused further
financial assistance in completing his college career.
Paul told me of this, and, at the same time,
of a splendid offer he had received to pitch professionally
on a bush-league team. He had this year
made a record for himself with his college team,
but it looked as if he would be forced to play for
money in order to pay his way through college.</p>

<p>“One year—spent mainly in waiting for clients—as
a lawyer in a small city had not placed me in
position to help him, but finally I was struck with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
the idea of filling that baseball opening in his
place. Belonging to an athletic club, I had kept in
good condition, having continued to pitch occasionally
after graduating from college. In ten or
twelve weeks of summer baseball, at the salary
offered, I could earn enough to pay my brother’s
expenses at Princeton for the coming year.</p>

<p>“If the man who had made the offer were to
learn that it was a brother of the famous Princeton
pitcher who responded, instead of the pitcher
himself, he might be inclined to cut down the
amount he had flourished as such an alluring bait,
and hence it was decided not to take him into our
confidence. Mr. Cope, I humbly crave your pardon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thunder!” exclaimed the delighted grocer.
“Don’t mention it! Lordy! Lordy! Ain’t it
funny!”</p>

<p>There were some persons present, however, to
whom the humor of the situation made no appeal
whatever.</p>

<p>The Kingsbridge pitcher continued:</p>

<p>“As the given name of both my brother and
myself begins with P, the mistake of the photographer
who handed out one of my pictures
when Mr. King’s obliging friend called for a
photograph of Paul Hazelton is readily understood.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
In order to settle this controversy for all
time, I thought best to wire my brother to come
on, and it was to meet him here in Bancroft that I
left Kingsbridge this morning. Gentlemen, let
me introduce Paul Hazelton.”</p>

<p>The youthful stranger who had arrived in company
with the bell boy bowed and smiled.</p>

<p>“I’m it,” he said. “But, to judge by his record
in this league, when it comes to pitching, I’m an
‘also ran’ compared with Phil.”</p>

<p>“It should be plain to you now, Mr. Riley,” said
Philip Hazelton grimly, “that you made a very
bad break when you produced a letter, seemingly
in my handwriting, dated at Princeton, and signed
with the name of Paul Hazelton. Mr. Hutchinson,
also, has blundered in— Oh, by the way where
is he? He seems to be missing.”</p>

<p>“He’s sneaked,” cried Sammy Bryant. “He
got out when nobody was lookin’.”</p>

<p>“He’d better sneak,” declared Henry Cope.
“I don’t blame him a bit for skedaddlin’ outer
here. He’d better git outer Kingsbridge in a
hurry, too.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The following evening found Philip Hazelton
meditating over a daintily perfumed note that
had been brought him by a boy. A dozen times<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
he read it; as many times he started up, as if
with a purpose, only to falter.</p>

<p>At last, however, he literally tore the blue-serge
suit off the hangers in the wardrobe, and lost no
time in donning it, save that wasted through the
fumbling produced by his almost frantic haste.</p>

<p>“After all,” he told himself, rejoicing, “she
wasn’t to blame. King did it with that photograph.
It’s no wonder she thought me untruthful.
Will I call at eight this evening; will I <em>please</em>
call at eight? Will I! It’s almost half past
seven now. I’m afraid I never can wait for eight
o’clock.”</p>

<p>It was Janet herself who let him in when he
rang at the parsonage door.</p>

<p>“Mr. Locke—I mean Hazelton,” she said, “I
want to offer you a humble apology. It was simply
dreadful of me. Can you pardon me?”</p>

<p>He did not leave her long in doubt, and the
pleasure of that Sunday meeting in the woods
paled in comparison with the delight of the ensuing
hour. Henry Cope had improved the first opportunity
to tell her all that had taken place at the
meeting in Bancroft.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she cried, when she thought of it, as
they sat close together in the parlor, “I have a
surprise for you. I told my father all about it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
and he says he knows your father; that they were
chums at college. Isn’t that a delightful coincidence.
And father wants to meet you, and I
think—I’m quite sure—he’ll form a better opinion
of some baseball players. I’m going to make
him let me attend every game here in Kingsbridge.
He just can’t keep me away, that’s all.”</p>

<p>Little did she realize when she spoke that she
was destined to witness Lefty’s struggles and
success as a Major League pitcher afar from
Kingsbridge and the “bush” where he had created
such a sensation. The story of his first season
in fast company is told in the next volume of
this series, the title of which is, “Lefty o’ the Big
League.”</p>

<p>In the course of their chat, he mentioned his
sister, whom he affectionately called “Tid,” but,
as she turned away at that moment, he failed to
detect the strange look that flashed into Janet’s
eyes. When he finally left, she accompanied him
to the door to let him out. The shaded lamp in
the hall was low and dim, and they stood there
some moments, close together, speaking in subdued
tones, save when—</p>

<p>After he was gone, she lingered by the door,
listening to the sound of his footsteps until it died
away on the silent street.</p>
